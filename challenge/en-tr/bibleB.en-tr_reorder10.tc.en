and God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
and the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he made the stars also .
and God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
but there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
and a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads .
and the name of the second river is Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia .
and the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria . and the fourth river is Euphrates .
and the Lord God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the rib , which the Lord God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
in the sweat of THY face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
so he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and in process of time it came to pass , that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord .
but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect . and Cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
and now art thou Cursed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receive THY brother 's blood from THY hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of Eden .
and Lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
and Adah bare Jabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of such as have cattle .
and his brother 's name was Jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
this is the book of the generations of Adam . in the day that God created man , in the likeness of God made he him ;
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name Seth :
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the Ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
but with thee will I establish my Covenant ; and thou shalt come into the Ark , thou , and THY sons , and THY wife , and THY sons ' wives with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the Ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the Ark , because of the waters of the flood .
and it came to pass after seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
in the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the Ark ;
they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and they went in unto Noah into the Ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the Lord shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the Ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the Ark went upon the face of the waters .
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
and God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the Ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ;
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
and the Ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the Ark which he had made :
and he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the Ark .
and Noah builded an altar unto the Lord ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
I do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a Covenant between me and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be seen in the cloud :
and the sons of Noah , that went forth of the Ark , were Shem , and ham , and Japheth : and ham is the father of Canaan .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's nakedness .
now these are the generations of the sons of Noah , Shem , ham , and Japheth : and unto them were sons born after the flood .
by these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands ; every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
and the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; as thou goest , unto Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboim , even unto Lasha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their countries , and in their nations .
unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born .
and unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother 's name was Joktan .
these are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations : and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
and it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; and they dwelt there .
and they said one to another , Go to , let us make brick , and burn them throughly . and they had brick for stone , and slime had they for morter .
and the Lord said , behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called Babel ; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
and Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
now the Lord had said unto Abram , Get thee out of THY country , and from THY kindred , and from THY father 's house , unto a land that I will shew thee :
and I will bless them that bless thee , and curse him that curseth thee : and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed .
so Abram departed , as the Lord had spoken unto him ; and lot went with him : and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .
and Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem , unto the plain of Moreh . and the Canaanite was then in the land .
and there was a famine in the land : and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was grievous in the land .
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
and it came to pass , that , when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
the princes also of Pharaoh saw her , and commended her before Pharaoh : and the woman was taken into Pharaoh 's house .
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold THY wife , take her , and go THY way .
unto the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first : and there Abram called on the name of the Lord .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
and there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram 's cattle and the herdmen of lot 's cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
and Abram said unto lot , Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee , and between my herdmen and THY herdmen ; for we be brethren .
and the Lord said unto Abram , after that lot was separated from him , Lift up now thine eyes , and look from the place where thou art northward , and southward , and eastward , and westward :
and I will make THY seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall THY seed also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for I will give it unto thee .
and it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar , Arioch king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer king of Elam , and tidal king of nations ;
and they returned , and came to En @-@ mishpat , which is Kadesh , and smote all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon @-@ Tamar .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eschol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive , he armed his trained servants , born in his own house , three hundred and Eighteen , and pursued them unto Dan .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered thine enemies into THY hand . and he gave him tithes of all .
save only that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men which went with me , Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre ; let them take their portion .
and Abram said , behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall THY seed be .
and he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces .
and Sarai Abram 's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
and the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
and the angel of the Lord said unto her , I will multiply THY seed exceedingly , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
neither shall THY name any more be called Abram , but THY name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
and I will make thee exceeding fruitful , and I will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and THY seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to THY seed after thee .
this is my Covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and THY seed after thee ; Every man child among you shall be circumcised .
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you .
he that is born in THY house , and he that is bought with THY money , must needs be circumcised : and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting Covenant .
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised , that soul shall be cut off from his people ; he hath broken my Covenant .
and as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and Abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and gave it unto a young man ; and he hasted to dress it .
and he took butter , and milk , and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they did eat .
now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
behold now , this city is near to flee unto , and it is a little one : Oh , let me escape thither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt .
and lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar : and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac .
and she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should have given children suck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
and the child grew , and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and said , By myself have I sworn , saith the Lord , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld THY son , thine only son :
and it came to pass after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , behold , Milcah , she hath also born children unto THY brother Nahor ;
and Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old : these were the years of the life of Sarah .
and Abraham stood up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of Heth .
and he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
and Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth .
and I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell :
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
behold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water :
and the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
and the man wondering at her held his peace , to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
and the Lord hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses .
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
and she say to me , Both drink thou , and I will also draw for THY camels : let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master 's son .
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give THY camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
behold , Rebekah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be THY master 's son 's wife , as the Lord hath spoken .
and it came to pass , that , when Abraham 's servant heard their words , he worshipped the Lord , bowing himself to the earth .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they sent away Rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and Abraham 's servant , and his men .
and they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let THY seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and Rebekah arose , and her damsels , and they rode upon the camels , and followed the man : and the servant took Rebekah , and went his way .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
and Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she lighted off the Camel .
and these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived , an hundred threescore and fifteen years .
then Abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ;
and it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai @-@ roi .
now these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bare unto Abraham :
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their castles ; twelve princes according to their nations .
and these are the years of the life of Ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan @-@ aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
and the children struggled together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? and she went to inquire of the Lord .
and there was a famine in the land , beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . and Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar .
and I will make THY seed to multiply as the stars of heaven , and will give unto THY seed all these countries ; and in THY seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
for all the wells which his father 's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water .
and Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite :
now therefore take , I pray thee , THY weapons , THY quiver and THY bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison ;
and make me savoury meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before I die .
and Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son . and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for THY father , such as he loveth :
and he went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made savoury meat , such as his father loved .
and Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jacob her younger son :
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his neck :
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
and when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , bless me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac his father answered and said unto him , behold , THY dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by THY sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve THY brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off THY neck .
and Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
and he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
and Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and he called the name of that place Bethel : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
and this stone , which I have set for a pillar , shall be God 's house : and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and Jacob told Rachel that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Rebekah 's son : and she ran and told her father .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon .
and Leah said , God hath given me my hire , because I have given my maiden to my husband : and she called his name Issachar .
and it came to pass , when Rachel had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
give me my wives and my children , for whom I have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service which I have done thee .
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
and he said , Lift up now thine eyes , and see , all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked , speckled , and grisled : for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee .
for all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our children 's : now then , whatsoever God hath said unto thee , do .
and Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount Gilead .
and now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after THY father 's house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
and Laban went into Jacob 's tent , and into Leah 's tent , and into the two maidservants ' tents ; but he found them not . then went he out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the images , and put them in the Camel 's furniture , and sat upon them . and Laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff , what hast thou found of all THY household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and THY brethren , that they may judge betwixt us both .
this twenty years have I been with thee ; THY ewes and THY she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of THY flock have I not eaten .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
now therefore come thou , let us make a Covenant , I and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
if thou shalt afflict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters , no man is with us ; see , God is witness betwixt me and thee .
this heap be witness , and this pillar be witness , that I will not pass over this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me , for harm .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ;
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto THY servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
then thou shalt say , They be THY servant Jacob 's ; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
and so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau , when ye find him .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
and he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and Leah also with her children came near , and bowed themselves : and after came Joseph near and Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
and Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padan @-@ aram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
and Dinah the daughter of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
and when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and defiled her .
and Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter : now his sons were with his cattle in the field : and Jacob held his peace until they were come .
and make ye marriages with us , and give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
but in this will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcised ;
but if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
and Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
and they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went out .
they took their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wives took they captive , and spoiled even all that was in the house .
then Jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments :
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
and they journeyed : and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob .
so Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
and he built there an altar , and called the place El @-@ Beth @-@ el : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
and God said unto him , Thy name is Jacob : THY name shall not be called any more Jacob , but Israel shall be THY name : and he called his name Israel .
and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to THY seed after thee will I give the land .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
and they journeyed from Bethel ; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath : and Rachel travailed , and she had hard labour .
and it came to pass , as her soul was in departing , ( for she died ) that she called his name Ben @-@ oni : but his father called him Benjamin .
and it came to pass , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father 's concubine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
and the sons of Zilpah , Leah 's handmaid ; Gad , and Asher : these are the sons of Jacob , which were born to him in Padan @-@ aram .
and Isaac gave up the ghost , and died , and was gathered unto his people , being old and full of days : and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
and Aholibamah bare Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah : these are the sons of Esau , which were born unto him in the land of Canaan .
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together ; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle .
these are the names of Esau 's sons ; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau , Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau .
and these were the sons of Aholibamah , the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : and she bare to Esau Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah .
these were dukes of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau ; Duke Teman , Duke Omar , Duke Zepho , Duke Kenaz ,
Duke Korah , Duke Gatam , and Duke Amalek : these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom ; these were the sons of Adah .
and these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau 's wife ; Duke Jeush , Duke Jaalam , Duke Korah : these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
and Dishon , and Ezer , and Dishan : these are the dukes of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .
Duke Dishon , Duke Ezer , Duke Dishan : these are the dukes that came of Hori , among their dukes in the land of Seir .
and these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom , before there reigned any king over the children of Israel .
and Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; Duke Timnah , Duke Alvah , Duke Jetheth ,
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Reuben returned unto the pit ; and , behold , Joseph was not in the pit ; and he rent his clothes .
and they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a kid of the goats , and dipped the coat in the blood ;
and they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be THY son 's coat or no .
and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she yet again conceived , and bare a son ; and called his name Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bare him .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and it came to pass in the time of her travail , that , behold , twins were in her womb .
and it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand : and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first ,
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
and the Lord was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and his master saw that the Lord was with him , and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
and Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
and it came to pass after these things , that his master 's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , Lie with me .
and it came to pass , as she spake to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she spake unto him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mock me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did THY servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
but the Lord was with Joseph , and shewed him mercy , and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the Lord was with him , and that which he did , the Lord made it to prosper .
and it came to pass after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt .
and Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers , against the chief of the butlers , and against the chief of the Bakers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them : and they continued a season in ward .
and Joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
and the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and in the vine were three branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes :
and Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto THY place : and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his Butler .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up THY head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat THY flesh from off thee .
and it came to pass the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast unto all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Baker among his servants .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed ; and they fed in a Meadow .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself , and changed his raiment , and came in unto Pharaoh .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favoured ; and they fed in a Meadow :
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness :
and when they had eaten them up , it could not be known that they had eaten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears : and I told this unto the magicians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine .
this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh : what God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh .
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt ; and the famine shall consume the land ;
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following ; for it shall be very grievous .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
Thou shalt be over my house , and according unto THY word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater than thou .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , See , I have set thee over all the land of Egypt .
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and the seven years of plenteousness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
and he said , behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
if ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of your houses :
and he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the Inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan , and told him all that befell unto them ; saying ,
the man , who is the lord of the land , spake roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
but if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
and they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they communed with him at the door of the house ,
and the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
and when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves to him to the earth .
and they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men marvelled one at another .
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him : but Benjamin 's mess was five times so much as any of theirs . and they drank , and were merry with him .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , and his corn money . and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of THY lord 's house silver or gold ?
and he searched , and began at the eldest , and left at the youngest : and the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
and Judah and his brethren came to Joseph 's house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
and it came to pass when we came up unto THY servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
now therefore , I pray thee , let THY servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
for how shall I go up to my father , and the lad be not with me ? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Thus saith THY son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tarry not :
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , Joseph 's brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto THY brethren , This do ye ; lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ;
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived :
and they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him :
and these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn .
these be the sons of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob in Padan @-@ aram , with his daughter Dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
and unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
these are the sons of Bilhah , which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter , and she bare these unto Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt , which came out of his loins , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were threescore and six ;
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
and as for the people , he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh 's .
and Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt , in the country of Goshen ; and they had possessions therein , and grew , and multiplied exceedingly .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and said unto me , behold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to THY seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
and now THY two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and THY issue , which thou begettest after them , shall be thine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near unto him .
moreover I have given to thee one portion above THY brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow .
O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
Judah , thou art he whom THY brethren shall praise : THY hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies ; THY father 's children shall bow down before thee .
the sceptre shall not depart from Judah , nor a lawgiver from between his feet , until Shiloh come ; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be .
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for an haven of ships ; and his border shall be unto Zidon .
but his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob ; ( from thence is the shepherd , the stone of Israel : )
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed : and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and they came to the threshingfloor of Atad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his brethren , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
but as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
and Joseph saw Ephraim 's children of the third generation : the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph 's knees .
so Joseph died , being an hundred and ten years old : and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
and all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
and the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew . and they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew Midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah :
and there went a man of the house of Levi , and took to wife a daughter of Levi .
and the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river ; and her maidens walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ark among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , behold , the babe wept . and she had compassion on him , and said , This is one of the Hebrews ' children .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
now the priest of Midian had seven daughters : and they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father 's flock .
now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb .
moreover he said , I am the God of THY father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and the Lord said , I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows ;
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
and Moses said unto God , Who am I , that I should go unto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
and he said , Put thine hand into THY bosom again . and he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with THY mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be THY spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
and the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spake to the people , saying , Thus saith Pharaoh , I will not give you straw .
there is no straw given unto THY servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , THY servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case , after it was said , Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task .
then the Lord said unto Moses , Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these be the heads of their fathers ' houses : the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel ; Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi : these be the families of Reuben .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman : these are the families of Simeon .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Aaron took him Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Naashon , to wife ; and she bare him Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
and Eleazar Aaron 's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the Lord said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee : and Aaron THY brother shall speak unto Pharaoh , that he send the children of Israel out of his land .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
and Moses was fourscore years old , and Aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto Pharaoh .
when Pharaoh shall speak unto you , saying , Shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto Aaron , Take THY rod , and cast it before Pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
and the fish that is in the river shall die , and the river shall stink ; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river .
and Pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
and all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and the frogs shall come up both on thee , and upon THY people , and upon all THY servants .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with THY rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
and the frogs shall depart from thee , and from THY houses , and from THY servants , and from THY people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
and the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and the Lord did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon THY servants , and upon THY people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and THY people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the Lord sent Thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
Intreat the Lord ( for it is enough ) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh : for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might shew these my signs before him :
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to morrow will I bring the locusts into THY coast :
and Moses said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
and the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind , which took away the locusts , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days : but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let every man borrow of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
speak ye unto all the Congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the Lord 's passover .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
and the children of Israel went away , and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
and Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required . and they spoiled the Egyptians .
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
now the sojourning of the children of Israel , who dwelt in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
but every man 's servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
and it came to pass the selfsame day , that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all THY quarters .
and thou shalt shew THY son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to THY fathers , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the Lord 's .
but God led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt .
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
but lift thou up THY rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
and the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians ,
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the sea .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth THY wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
and with the blast of THY nostrils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood upright as an heap , and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them .
Thou in THY mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in THY strength unto THY holy habitation .
then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .
fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till THY people pass over , O Lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
and Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
so Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the Lord ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
and it came to pass , as Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
and it came to pass , that at even the quails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when they did Mete it with an Omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
and they laid it up till the morning , as Moses bade : and it did not stink , neither was there any worm therein .
and it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .
and the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
and the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
and the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and THY rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
so Joshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with Amalek : and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua : for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven .
when Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God :
and Moses went out to meet his father in law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and Jethro rejoiced for all the Goodness which the Lord had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father in law before God .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening .
Thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
Hearken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : be thou for the people to Godward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God :
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
if thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
and Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
for they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
and Moses went up unto God , and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians , and how I bare you on eagles ' wings , and brought you unto myself .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my Covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed louder and louder , Moses spake , and God answered him by a voice .
and the Lord came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
I am the Lord THY God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
Thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is THY neighbour 's .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up THY tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
and if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand ; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
and if a man smite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall be surely punished .
and if a man smite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
and if he smite out his manservant 's tooth , or his maidservant 's tooth ; he shall let him go free for his tooth 's sake .
if an ox Gore a man or a woman , that they die : then the ox shall be surely stoned , and his flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the ox shall be quit .
if there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
if a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
if a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass , or an ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or driven away , no man seeing it :
and if a man borrow ought of his neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof being not with it , he shall surely make it good .
if thou afflict them in any wise , and they cry at all unto me , I will surely hear their cry ;
and my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
if thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee , thou shalt not be to him as an usurer , neither shalt thou lay upon him usury .
if thou at all take THY neighbour 's raiment to pledge , thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down :
for that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of THY ripe fruits , and of THY liquors : the firstborn of THY sons shalt thou give unto me .
likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen , and with THY sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of THY mouth .
the first of the firstfruits of THY land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord THY God . Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother 's milk .
behold , I send an Angel before thee , to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .
for mine Angel shall go before thee , and bring thee in unto the Amorites , and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites : and I will cut them off .
Thou shalt not bow down to their gods , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but thou shalt utterly overthrow them , and quite break down their images .
and ye shall serve the Lord your God , and he shall bless THY bread , and THY water ; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee .
there shall nothing cast their young , nor be barren , in THY land : the number of THY days I will fulfil .
and I will send hornets before thee , which shall drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite , from before thee .
they shall not dwell in THY land , lest they make thee sin against me : for if thou serve their gods , it will surely be a snare unto thee .
and Moses wrote all the words of the Lord , and rose up early in the morning , and builded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
and Moses took half of the blood , and put it in basons ; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
and he took the book of the Covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the Lord hath said will we do , and be obedient .
and upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand : also they saw God , and did eat and drink .
and the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days : and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel .
and Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring me an offering : of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering .
according to all that I shew thee , after the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all the instruments thereof , even so shall ye make it .
and they shall make an Ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the Ark , that the Ark may be borne with them .
the staves shall be in the rings of the Ark : they shall not be taken from it .
and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and make one cherub on the one end , and the other cherub on the other end : even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , and their faces shall look one to another ; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be .
and thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the Ark ; and in the Ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee .
Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood : two cubits shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about , and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
and thou shalt make for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof .
and thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold , that the table may be borne with them .
and thou shalt make the dishes thereof , and spoons thereof , and covers thereof , and bowls thereof , to cover withal : of pure gold shalt thou make them .
and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it .
the length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and every one of the curtains shall have one measure .
the five curtains shall be coupled together one to another ; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another .
and thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling ; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
the length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure .
and thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make fifty taches of brass , and put the taches into the loops , and couple the tent together , that it may be one .
and the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remaineth , shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle .
ten cubits shall be the length of a board , and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board .
two tenons shall there be in one board , set in order one against another : thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle , twenty boards on the south side southward .
and thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
and they shall be eight boards , and their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and thou shalt overlay the boards with gold , and make their rings of gold for places for the bars : and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold .
and thou shalt set the table without the vail , and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south : and thou shalt put the table on the north side .
and thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold , and their hooks shall be of gold : and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them .
and thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood , five cubits long , and five cubits broad ; the altar shall be foursquare : and the height thereof shall be three cubits .
and thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof : his horns shall be of the same : and thou shalt overlay it with brass .
and thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes , and his shovels , and his basons , and his fleshhooks , and his firepans : all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass .
and thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass ; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof .
and thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath , that the net may be even to the midst of the altar .
and the staves shall be put into the rings , and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar , to bear it .
and thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle : for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side :
and likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long , and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
all the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver ; their hooks shall be of silver , and their sockets of brass .
all the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof , and all the pins thereof , and all the pins of the court , shall be of brass .
and thou shalt command the children of Israel , that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamp to burn always .
it shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof ; and so it shall be joined together .
and the curious girdle of the ephod , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
and thou shalt make ouches of gold ;
and thou shalt set in it settings of stones , even four rows of stones : the first row shall be a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this shall be the first row .
and thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold , and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate .
and thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate .
and the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it .
and thou shalt make two rings of gold , and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof , which is in the side of the ephod inward .
and two other rings of gold thou shalt make , and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart thereof , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about :
and it shall be upon Aaron to minister : and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord , and when he cometh out , that he die not .
and thou shalt put it on a blue lace , that it may be upon the Mitre ; upon the forefront of the Mitre it shall be .
and for Aaron 's sons thou shalt make coats , and thou shalt make for them girdles , and bonnets shalt thou make for them , for glory and for beauty .
and thou shalt put them upon Aaron THY brother , and his sons with him ; and shalt anoint them , and consecrate them , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them , to minister unto me in the priest 's office : take one young bullock , and two rams without blemish ,
and thou shalt put them into one basket , and bring them in the basket , with the bullock and the two rams .
and Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shalt wash them with water .
and thou shalt take the garments , and put upon Aaron the coat , and the robe of the ephod , and the ephod , and the breastplate , and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod :
and thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock .
and thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul that is above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and burn them upon the altar .
but the flesh of the bullock , and his skin , and his Dung , shalt thou burn with fire without the camp : it is a sin offering .
and thou shalt slay the ram , and thou shalt take his blood , and sprinkle it round about upon the altar .
and thou shalt cut the ram in pieces , and wash the inwards of him , and his legs , and put them unto his pieces , and unto his head .
and thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar : it is a burnt offering unto the Lord : it is a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and thou shalt receive them of their hands , and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour before the Lord : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron 's consecration , and wave it for a wave offering before the Lord : and it shall be THY part .
and that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days , when he cometh into the tabernacle of the Congregation to minister in the holy place .
and if ought of the flesh of the consecrations , or of the bread , remain unto the morning , then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire : it shall not be eaten , because it is holy .
and thus shalt thou do unto Aaron , and to his sons , according to all things which I have commanded thee : seven days shalt thou consecrate them .
the one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning ; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even :
and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering .
and there I will meet with the children of Israel , and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory .
and I will sanctify the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the altar : I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the priest 's office .
and they shall know that I am the Lord their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them : I am the Lord their God .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , the top thereof , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns thereof ; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the Ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with thee .
and when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even , he shall burn incense upon it , a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations .
this they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary : ( a shekel is twenty gerahs : ) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord .
every one that passeth among them that are numbered , from twenty years old and above , shall give an offering unto the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the Lord , to make an Atonement for your souls .
and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment , an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary : it shall be an holy anointing oil .
and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
upon man 's flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the Congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord .
and I have filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the Ark of the testimony , and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle ,
and the cloths of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office ,
Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God .
and Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
and they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
and Moses besought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why doth THY wrath wax hot against THY people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , Graven upon the tables .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do I hear .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Who is on the Lord 's side ? let him come unto me . and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an Atonement for your sin .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin-- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of THY book which thou hast written .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
and I will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
Lest thou make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ;
and thou take of their daughters unto THY sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make THY sons go a whoring after their gods .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge THY borders : neither shall any man desire THY land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord THY God thrice in the year .
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
the first of the firstfruits of THY land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord THY God . Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother 's milk .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Moses gathered all the Congregation of the children of Israel together , and said unto them , These are the words which the Lord hath commanded , that ye should do them .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the Lord : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
and Moses spake unto all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord commanded , saying ,
and the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle ,
the pins of the tabernacle , and the pins of the court , and their cords ,
the cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the Lord 's offering : and every man , with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , both of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine linen .
and the rulers brought onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ;
the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses .
and he hath filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ;
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
and they spake unto Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the Lord commanded to make .
and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work made he them .
the length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : the curtains were all of one size .
and he coupled the five curtains one unto another : and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another .
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
the length of one curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain : the eleven curtains were of one size .
the length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
and forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
and he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the Ark , to bear the Ark .
and he made the mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half was the length thereof , and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and he made two cherubims of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mercy seat ;
one cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side : out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he made the table of shittim wood : two cubits was the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof :
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his Shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and six branches going out of the sides thereof ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof :
and he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he made the holy anointing oil , and the pure incense of sweet spices , according to the work of the apothecary .
and he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood : five cubits was the length thereof , and five cubits the breadth thereof ; it was foursquare ; and three cubits the height thereof .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , and the shovels , and the basons , and the fleshhooks , and the firepans : all the vessels thereof made he of brass .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar , to bear it withal ; he made the altar hollow with boards .
and he made the laver of brass , and the foot of it of brass , of the lookingglasses of the women assembling , which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits , their pillars were twenty , and their sockets of brass twenty ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
and for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
and their pillars were four , and their sockets of brass four ; their hooks of silver , and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver .
and Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah , made all that the Lord commanded Moses .
and with him was Aholiab , son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
and the silver of them that were numbered of the Congregation was an hundred talents , and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars , and overlaid their chapiters , and filleted them .
and of the blue , and purple , and scarlet , they made cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and they did beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , and in the purple , and in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , with cunning work .
and they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold , Graven , as signets are Graven , with the names of the children of Israel .
and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he made the breastplate of cunning work , like the work of the ephod ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
it was foursquare ; they made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
and they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this was the first row .
and the fourth row , a beryl , an onyx , and a jasper : they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet , every one with his name , according to the twelve tribes .
and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate .
and the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
and they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ephod inward .
and they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO the Lord .
thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the Congregation finished : and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so did they .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the Lord had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
and thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the Ark of the testimony , and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle .
and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the Congregation .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the Congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering , and all his vessels , and sanctify the altar : and it shall be an altar most holy .
and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and wash them with water .
and thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
and Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
and he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he took and put the testimony into the Ark , and set the staves on the Ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the Ark :
and he brought the Ark into the tabernacle , and set up the vail of the covering , and covered the Ark of the testimony ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he put the table in the tent of the Congregation , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the vail .
and he put the candlestick in the tent of the Congregation , over against the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
when they went into the tent of the Congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so Moses finished the work .
and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the Congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys :
but if the cloud were not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
for the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .
and the Lord called unto Moses , and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the Congregation , saying ,
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord .
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make Atonement for him .
and he shall kill the bullock before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall bring the blood , and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar , and lay the wood in order upon the fire :
and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the fat , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
and the priest shall bring it unto the altar , and wring off his head , and burn it on the altar ; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar :
and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers , and cast it beside the altar on the east part , by the place of the ashes :
and when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord , his offering shall be of fine flour ; and he shall pour oil upon it , and put frankincense thereon :
and the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
and thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the Lord : and when it is presented unto the priest , he shall bring it unto the altar .
and the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof , and shall burn it upon the altar : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
as for the oblation of the firstfruits , ye shall offer them unto the Lord : but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour .
and every oblation of THY meat offering shalt thou season with salt ; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the Covenant of THY God to be lacking from THY meat offering : with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt .
and the priest shall burn the memorial of it , part of the beaten corn thereof , and part of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering , if he offer it of the herd ; whether it be a male or female , he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and Aaron 's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and the priest shall burn it upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour : all the fat is the Lord 's .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering .
and he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord ; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock 's head , and kill the bullock before the Lord .
and the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock 's blood , and bring it to the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord , before the vail of the sanctuary .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering .
when the sin , which they have sinned against it , is known , then the Congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin , and bring him before the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the elders of the Congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the Lord : and the bullock shall be killed before the Lord .
and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord , even before the vail .
and he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an Atonement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp , and burn him as he burned the first bullock : it is a sin offering for the Congregation .
when a ruler hath sinned , and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord his God concerning things which should not be done , and is guilty ;
or if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a male without blemish :
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord : it is a sin offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering , and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering .
and the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering , and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar :
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
and it shall be , when he shall be guilty in one of these things , that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing :
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder :
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with THY estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord : and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein .
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
and the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eat it .
and the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the Lord , it shall be wholly burnt .
the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place .
but the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken : and if it be sodden in a brasen pot , it shall be both scoured , and rinsed in water .
and no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the Congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering : and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar .
and the priest that offereth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest 's that offereth it .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord , and it shall be the priest 's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
and the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for Thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire .
moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
his own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire , the fat with the breast , it shall he bring , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord .
and the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
he among the sons of Aaron , that offereth the blood of the peace offerings , and the fat , shall have the right shoulder for his part .
which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
which the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord , in the wilderness of Sinai .
and Moses did as the Lord commanded him ; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he put the Mitre upon his head ; also upon the Mitre , even upon his forefront , did he put the golden plate , the holy crown ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron 's head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
and he brought the bullock for the sin offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering .
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
and he cut the ram into pieces ; and Moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he put all upon Aaron 's hands , and upon his sons ' hands , and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation in seven days , until the days of your consecration be at an end : for seven days shall he consecrate you .
as he hath done this day , so the Lord hath commanded to do , to make an Atonement for you .
and it came to pass on the eighth day , that Moses called Aaron and his sons , and the elders of Israel ;
and they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and all the Congregation drew near and stood before the Lord .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver of the sin offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and they presented the burnt offering unto him , with the pieces thereof , and the head : and he burnt them upon the altar .
and he brought the people 's offering , and took the goat , which was the sin offering for the people , and slew it , and offered it for sin , as the first .
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about ,
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver :
and Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people , and blessed them , and came down from offering of the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and peace offerings .
and Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the Congregation , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people .
and there came a fire out from before the Lord , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor THY sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the Congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses .
behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the Camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
and the swine , though he divide the hoof , and be clovenfooted , yet he cheweth not the cud ; he is unclean to you .
and all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
they shall be even an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , but ye shall have their carcases in abomination .
yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four , which have legs above their feet , to leap withal upon the earth ;
and whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
but if any water be put upon the seed , and any part of their carcase fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you .
and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
for I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
but if she bear a maid child , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her separation : and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days .
who shall offer it before the Lord , and make an Atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ;
and the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce him to be unclean : for the raw flesh is unclean : it is a leprosy .
the flesh also , in which , even in the skin thereof , was a boil , and is healed ,
but if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
or if there be any flesh , in the skin whereof there is a hot burning , and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot , somewhat reddish , or white ;
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague : and , behold , if the scall spread not , and there be in it no yellow hair , and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin ;
then the priest shall look on him : and , behold , if the scall be spread in the skin , the priest shall not seek for yellow hair ; he is unclean .
but if the scall be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the scall is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is forehead bald : yet is he clean .
and the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip , and shall cry , Unclean , unclean .
all the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled ; he is unclean : he shall dwell alone ; without the camp shall his habitation be .
the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it be in the warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skin ;
he shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if it appear still in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a spreading plague : thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire .
and the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
and the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall take some of the log of oil , and pour it into the palm of his own left hand :
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord :
and the remnant of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
and the priest shall offer the sin offering , and make an Atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness ; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering :
and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
and two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a burnt offering .
and he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest , unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , before the Lord .
and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering , and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord :
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord :
and the rest of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , to make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
this is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing .
when ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house :
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days :
and the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is , and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city :
and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
and if the plague come again , and break out in the house , after that he hath taken away the stones , and after he hath scraped the house , and after it is plaistered ;
then the priest shall come and look , and , behold , if the plague be spread in the house , it is a fretting leprosy in the house : it is unclean .
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the timber thereof , and all the morter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place .
and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes ; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is unclean .
and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue : whether his flesh run with his issue , or his flesh be stopped from his issue , it is his uncleanness .
every bed , whereon he lieth that hath the issue , is unclean : and every thing , whereon he sitteth , shall be unclean .
and he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean ; then he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and the vessel of earth , that he toucheth which hath the issue , shall be broken : and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord for his issue .
and if any man 's seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
and every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
and if a woman have an issue , and her issue in her flesh be blood , she shall be put apart seven days : and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even .
and if it be on her bed , or on any thing whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
and if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be unclean seven days ; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean .
every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation : and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean , as the uncleanness of her separation .
and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles , or two young pigeons , and bring them unto the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall take the two goats , and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats ; one lot for the Lord , and the other lot for the scapegoat .
but the goat , on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an Atonement with him , and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness .
and Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an Atonement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the vail :
and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
and he shall take of the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward ; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times .
and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times , and cleanse it , and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel .
and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the altar , he shall bring the live goat :
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
and Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall put off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there :
and he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward come into the camp .
and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
for on that day shall the priest make an Atonement for you , to cleanse you , that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord .
speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , saying ,
what man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp ,
and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring . this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations .
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , to offer it unto the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes , and my judgments : which if a man do , he shall live in them : I am the Lord .
the nakedness of THY father , or the nakedness of THY mother , shalt thou not uncover : she is THY mother ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
the nakedness of THY sister , the daughter of THY father , or daughter of THY mother , whether she be born at home , or born abroad , even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY father 's brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is thine aunt .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY daughter in law : she is THY son 's wife ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to uncover her nakedness ; for they are her near kinswomen : it is wickedness .
neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister , to vex her , to uncover her nakedness , beside the other in her life time .
and thou shalt not let any of THY seed pass through the fire to Molech , neither shalt thou profane the name of THY God : I am the Lord .
( for all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ; )
for whosoever shall commit any of these abominations , even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people .
speak unto all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the Lord your God am holy .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of THY field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of THY harvest .
and thou shalt not glean THY vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of THY vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the Lord your God .
Thou shalt not defraud THY neighbour , neither rob him : the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning .
Thou shalt not curse the deaf , nor put a stumblingblock before the blind , but shalt fear THY God : I am the Lord .
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment : thou shalt not respect the person of the poor , nor honour the person of the mighty : but in righteousness shalt thou judge THY neighbour .
Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among THY people : neither shalt thou stand against the blood of THY neighbour : I am the Lord .
Thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of THY people , but thou shalt love THY neighbour as thyself : I am the Lord .
Ye shall keep my statutes . Thou shalt not let THY cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow THY field with mingled seed : neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , even a ram for a trespass offering .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : I am the Lord your God .
Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the Lord .
do not prostitute THY daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
just balances , just weights , a just ephah , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he giveth of his seed unto Molech , and kill him not :
and the man that lieth with his father 's wife hath uncovered his father 's nakedness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an unclean thing : he hath uncovered his brother 's nakedness ; they shall be childless .
and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I abhorred them .
and for his sister a virgin , that is nigh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be defiled .
they shall not make baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard , nor make any cuttings in their flesh .
they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
a widow , or a divorced woman , or profane , or an harlot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or any thing superfluous ,
or crookbackt , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or be scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ;
the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing : a sojourner of the priest , or an hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing .
but if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
if the priest 's daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer unto the Lord ;
but whatsoever hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a Wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the Lord , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the Lord .
Ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised , or crushed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land .
on the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : I am the Lord .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , concerning the feasts of the Lord , which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations , even these are my feasts .
and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord : seven days ye must eat unleavened bread .
but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days : in the seventh day is an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
and ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor parched corn , nor green ears , until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath , from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering ; seven sabbaths shall be complete :
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , In the seventh month , in the first day of the month , shall ye have a sabbath , a memorial of blowing of trumpets , an holy convocation .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of Atonement , to make an Atonement for you before the Lord your God .
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day , the same soul will I destroy from among his people .
beside the sabbaths of the Lord , and beside your gifts , and beside all your vows , and beside all your freewill offerings , which ye give unto the Lord .
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
and the son of an Israelitish woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
and he that killeth a beast , he shall restore it : and he that killeth a man , he shall be put to death .
Ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for I am the Lord your God .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord .
six years thou shalt sow THY field , and six years thou shalt prune THY vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the Lord : thou shalt neither sow THY field , nor prune THY vineyard .
that which groweth of its own accord of THY harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of THY vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for THY servant , and for THY maid , and for THY hired servant , and for THY stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of Atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of THY vine undressed .
and if thou sell ought unto THY neighbour , or buyest ought of THY neighbour 's hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
Ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear THY God : for I am the Lord your God .
and if ye shall say , What shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase :
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
if THY brother be waxen poor , and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which his brother sold .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he redeem it .
and if THY brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
for they are my servants , which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : they shall not be sold as bondmen .
both THY bondmen , and THY bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
if there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
and if he be not redeemed in these years , then he shall go out in the year of jubile , both he , and his children with him .
for unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
and five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
and if ye shall despise my statutes , or if your soul abhor my judgments , so that ye will not do all my commandments , but that ye break my Covenant :
and I will set my face against you , and ye shall be slain before your enemies : they that hate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
and I will break the pride of your power ; and I will make your heaven as iron , and your earth as brass :
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be desolate .
and when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
and I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
and I will make your cities waste , and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation , and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours .
and I will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and your land shall be desolate , and your cities waste .
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in your enemies ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy her sabbaths .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest ; because it did not rest in your sabbaths , when ye dwelt upon it .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies .
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
if they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
and that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity :
then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob , and also my Covenant with Isaac , and also my Covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
but I will for their sakes remember the Covenant of their ancestors , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen , that I might be their God : I am the Lord .
and THY estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old , even THY estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old , then THY estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
and if it be from sixty years old and above ; if it be a male , then THY estimation shall be fifteen shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
but if he be poorer than THY estimation , then he shall present himself before the priest , and the priest shall value him ; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more .
but the field , when it goeth out in the jubile , shall be holy unto the Lord , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest 's .
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .
none devoted , which shall be devoted of men , shall be redeemed ; but shall surely be put to death .
and all the tithe of the land , whether of the seed of the land , or of the fruit of the tree , is the Lord 's : it is holy unto the Lord .
and concerning the tithe of the herd , or of the flock , even of whatsoever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord .

so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents , every man by his own camp , and every man by his own standard , throughout their hosts .
but the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the Congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony .

these are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers : all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses : so they pitched by their standards , and so they set forward , every one after their families , according to the house of their fathers .
these also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spake with Moses in mount Sinai .
and they shall keep his charge , and the charge of the whole Congregation before the tabernacle of the Congregation , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the charge of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons : they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel .
and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest 's office : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and I , behold , I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel : therefore the Levites shall be mine ;
and the sons of Merari by their families ; Mahli , and Mushi . these are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers .
of Gershon was the family of the Libnites , and the family of the Shimites : these are the families of the Gershonites .

and all the firstborn males by the number of names , from a month old and upward , of those that were numbered of them , were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen .
take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel , and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle ; and the Levites shall be mine : I am the Lord .
and for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel , which are more than the Levites ;
Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll , after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them : ( the shekel is twenty gerahs : )
and thou shalt give the money , wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed , unto Aaron and to his sons .
of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money ; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and when the camp setteth forward , Aaron shall come , and his sons , and they shall take down the covering vail , and cover the Ark of testimony with it :
and shall put thereon the covering of badgers ' skins , and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue , and shall put in the staves thereof .
and upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put thereon the dishes , and the spoons , and the bowls , and covers to cover withal : and the continual bread shall be thereon :
and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet , and cover the same with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put in the staves thereof .
and they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put it upon a bar .
and upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue , and cover it with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put to the staves thereof :

at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .

even those that were numbered of them after their families , were three thousand and two hundred .
these be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari , whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
even those that were numbered of them , were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore .
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the Lord spake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of THY husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband :
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into THY bowels , to make THY belly to swell , and THY thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , Amen , amen .
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the kernels even to the husk .
he shall not make himself unclean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consecration of his God is upon his head .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an Atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
and he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
and this is the law of the Nazarite , when the days of his separation are fulfilled : he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord , with the basket of unleavened bread : the priest shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari , according unto their service , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but unto the sons of Kohath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
and he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah :
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Nethaneel the son of Zuar .
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Eliab the son of Helon .

and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan .
this was the dedication of the altar , in the day when it was anointed , by the princes of Israel : twelve chargers of silver , twelve silver bowls , twelve spoons of gold :
the golden spoons were twelve , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary : all the gold of the spoons was an hundred and twenty shekels .
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the Shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
and thus shalt thou do unto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle water of purifying upon them , and let them shave all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselves clean .
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together :
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites :
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may execute the service of the Lord .
and thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering unto the Lord .
and after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and thou shalt cleanse them , and offer them for an offering .
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel , have I taken them unto me .
for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself .
and the Levites were purified , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord ; and Aaron made an Atonement for them to cleanse them .
this is it that belongeth unto the Levites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the Congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge .
and the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai : according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so did the children of Israel .
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
they shall leave none of it unto the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it .
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle , namely , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
at the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched : as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents .
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord , and journeyed not .
and so it was , when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle ; according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents , and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed .
at the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents , and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
make thee two trumpets of silver ; of a whole piece shalt thou make them : that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the journeying of the camps .
and if they blow but with one trumpet , then the princes , which are heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves unto thee .
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony .
and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies : and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar .
and the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward , bearing the tabernacle .
and the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts : and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran .
thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
and it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be , that what Goodness the Lord shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee .
and they departed from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey : and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and it came to pass , when the Ark set forward , that Moses said , Rise up , Lord , and let thine enemies be scattered ; and let them that hate thee flee before thee .
we remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlick :
then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly ; Moses also was displeased .
and if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in THY sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness .
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
and Moses went out , and told the people the words of the Lord , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them round about the tabernacle .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ERE it was chewed , the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people , and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague .
and Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married : for he had married an Ethiopian woman .
( now the man Moses was very meek , above all the men which were upon the face of the earth . )
and the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth .
with him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , Miriam became leprous , white as snow : and Aaron looked upon Miriam , and , behold , she was leprous .
and Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the wilderness of Paran : all those men were heads of the children of Israel .
of the tribe of Joseph , namely , of the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi the son of Susi .
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ;
and they ascended by the south , and came unto Hebron ; where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
and they came unto the Brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
the place was called the Brook Eshcol , because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence .
and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
and Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
if the Lord delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the Lord is with us : fear them not .
but all the Congregation bade stone them with stones . and the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the Congregation before all the children of Israel .
and now , I beseech thee , let the power of my Lord be great , according as thou hast spoken , saying ,
pardon , I beseech thee , the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of THY mercy , and as thou hast forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now .
surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it :
( now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley . ) To morrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of nun .
but your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despised .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
I the Lord have said , I will surely do it unto all this evil Congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
and the men , which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the Congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land ,
but Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still .
for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye are turned away from the Lord , therefore the Lord will not be with you .
but they presumed to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and Moses , departed not out of the camp .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you ,
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
thus shall it be done for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
according to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner , in offering an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the Congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the Lord .
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord .
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
and it shall be forgiven all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an Atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
and they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
and take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the Lord every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also , and Aaron , each of you his censer .
and they took every man his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation with Moses and Aaron .
and Korah gathered all the Congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the Congregation .
and it came to pass , as he had made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground clave asunder that was under them :
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the Congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an Atonement for the people .
now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside them that died about the matter of Korah .
and thou shalt write Aaron 's name upon the rod of Levi : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers .
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the Congregation before the testimony , where I will meet with you .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and they shall keep THY charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the altar : that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel .
and I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the Lord , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
and , behold , I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you , as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord , of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it .
and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest , that he may bring her forth without the camp , and one shall slay her before his face :
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the Congregation seven times :
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her Dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
this is the law , when a man dieth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that is in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them .
and Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the Congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron , Because ye believed me not , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this Congregation into the land which I have given them .
how our fathers went down into Egypt , and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians vexed us , and our fathers :
and the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , journeyed from Kadesh , and came unto mount Hor .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the coast of the land of Edom , saying ,
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah .
and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
and Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount .
and when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea , to compass the land of Edom : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
and they journeyed from Oboth , and pitched at Ije @-@ abarim , in the wilderness which is before Moab , toward the sunrising .
from thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites : for Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar , and lieth upon the border of Moab .
the princes digged the well , the nobles of the people digged it , by the direction of the lawgiver , with their staves . and from the wilderness they went to Mattanah :
and from Bamoth in the valley , that is in the country of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looketh toward Jeshimon .
and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
and Israel took all these cities : and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all the villages thereof .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
for there is a fire gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon : it hath consumed Ar of Moab , and the lords of the high places of Arnon .
and they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
and Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
and the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
but the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
and the angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she fell down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , surely now also I had slain thee , and saved her alive .
and the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
and when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
and Balaam said unto Balak , Lo , I am come unto thee : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God putteth in my mouth , that shall I speak .
for from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob , neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel : the Lord his God is with him , and the shout of a king is among them .
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
and when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes ; and the spirit of God came upon him .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
as the valleys are they spread forth , as gardens by the river 's side , as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted , and as cedar trees beside the waters .
he shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn : he shall eat up the nations his enemies , and shall break their bones , and Pierce them through with his arrows .
and Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
and now , behold , I go unto my people : come therefore , and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to THY people in the latter days .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
he hath said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
and when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable , and said , Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and he looked on the Kenites , and took up his parable , and said , Strong is THY dwellingplace , and thou puttest THY nest in a rock .
and ships shall come from the coast of Chittim , and shall afflict Asshur , and shall afflict Eber , and he also shall perish for ever .
and when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from among the Congregation , and took a javelin in his hand ;
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his God , and made an Atonement for the children of Israel .
now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
and the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Midian .
Reuben , the eldest son of Israel : the children of Reuben ; Hanoch , of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites : of Pallu , the family of the Palluites :
these are the families of the Reubenites : and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died , what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men : and they became a sign .
the sons of Simeon after their families : of Nemuel , the family of the Nemuelites : of Jamin , the family of the Jaminites : of Jachin , the family of the Jachinites :
the children of Gad after their families : of Zephon , the family of the Zephonites : of Haggi , the family of the Haggites : of Shuni , the family of the Shunites :
these are the families of the children of Gad according to those that were numbered of them , forty thousand and five hundred .
the sons of Judah were ER and Onan : and ER and Onan died in the land of Canaan .
and the sons of Judah after their families were ; of Shelah , the family of the Shelanites : of Pharez , the family of the Pharzites : of Zerah , the family of the Zarhites .
these are the families of Judah according to those that were numbered of them , threescore and sixteen thousand and five hundred .
of the sons of Issachar after their families : of Tola , the family of the Tolaites : of Pua , the family of the Punites :
these are the families of Issachar according to those that were numbered of them , threescore and four thousand and three hundred .
of the sons of Zebulun after their families : of Sered , the family of the Sardites : of Elon , the family of the Elonites : of Jahleel , the family of the Jahleelites .
these are the families of the Zebulunites according to those that were numbered of them , threescore thousand and five hundred .
of the sons of Manasseh : of Machir , the family of the Machirites : and Machir begat Gilead : of Gilead come the family of the Gileadites .
and Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
these are the families of Manasseh , and those that were numbered of them , fifty and two thousand and seven hundred .
these are the sons of Ephraim after their families : of Shuthelah , the family of the Shuthalhites : of Becher , the family of the Bachrites : of Tahan , the family of the Tahanites .
these are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them , thirty and two thousand and five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .
the sons of Benjamin after their families : of Bela , the family of the Belaites : of Ashbel , the family of the Ashbelites : of Ahiram , the family of the Ahiramites :
these are the sons of Benjamin after their families : and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six hundred .
these are the sons of Dan after their families : of Shuham , the family of the Shuhamites . these are the families of Dan after their families .
all the families of the Shuhamites , according to those that were numbered of them , were threescore and four thousand and four hundred .
of the children of Asher after their families : of Jimna , the family of the Jimnites : of Jesui , the family of the Jesuites : of Beriah , the family of the Beriites .
these are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them ; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
these are the families of Naphtali according to their families : and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and four hundred .
these were the numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
these are the families of the Levites : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korathites . and Kohath begat Amram .
and the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt : and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
these are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered , when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ? give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brethren ; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
and if he have no daughter , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren .
and if he have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father 's brethren .
for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin , in the strife of the Congregation , to sanctify me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin .
and Moses spake unto the Lord , saying ,
and thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him , that all the Congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient .
and Moses did as the Lord commanded him : and he took Joshua , and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the Congregation :
and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and thou shalt say unto them , This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the Lord ; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day , for a continual burnt offering .
the one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning , and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even ;
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord .
and the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb : in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering .
and three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one bullock ; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one ram ;
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the Lord ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the Lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
and in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you .
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock , for the ram , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded .
if a man vow a vow unto the Lord , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
these are the statutes , which the Lord commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father 's house .
and Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
and Moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the Congregation of the Lord .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp .
take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou , and Eleazar the priest , and the chief fathers of the Congregation :
and divide the prey into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Congregation :
and the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and thirty and two thousand persons in all , of woman that had not known man by lying with him .
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep :
and Moses gave the tribute , which was the Lord 's heave offering , unto Eleazar the priest , as the Lord commanded Moses .
( now the half that pertained unto the Congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near unto Moses :
and they said unto Moses , Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there lacketh not one man of us .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
and Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tabernacle of the Congregation , for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .
Wherefore , said they , if we have found grace in THY sight , let this land be given unto THY servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them ?
and the Lord 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the Lord , was consumed .
and , behold , ye are risen up in your fathers ' stead , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return unto our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
and the land be subdued before the Lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
so concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun , and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel :
and the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,
and the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kirjathaim ,
and the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead , and took it , and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
and Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the Lord : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
and they departed from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians .
and they departed from Succoth , and pitched in Etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness .
and they removed from Etham , and turned again unto Pi @-@ hahiroth , which is before Baal @-@ zephon : and they pitched before Migdol .
and they departed from before Pi @-@ hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness , and went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and pitched in Marah .
and they removed from Marah , and came unto Elim : and in Elim were twelve fountains of water , and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they pitched there .
and they took their journey out of the wilderness of sin , and encamped in Dophkah .
and they removed from Kadesh , and pitched in mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
and Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor .
and king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their molten images , and quite pluck down all their high places :
moreover it shall come to pass , that I shall do unto you , as I thought to do unto them .
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom , and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward :
and the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
from mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad :
and the border shall go on to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar @-@ enan : this shall be your north border .
and the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward :
the prince of the children of Joseph , for the tribe of the children of Manasseh , Hanniel the son of Ephod .
command the children of Israel , that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
and the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
and the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither : and to them ye shall add forty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
or with any stone , wherewith a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it upon him , that he die , and was not his enemy , neither sought his harm :
and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge , and the revenger of blood kill the Slayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the Slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
Whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer , which is guilty of death : but he shall be surely put to death .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
this is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
and they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the commandments and the judgments , which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
the Lord your God hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
( the Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you ! )
and I said unto you , Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites , which the Lord our God doth give unto us .
and they turned and went up into the mountain , and came unto the valley of Eshcol , and searched it out .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
but Joshua the son of nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
and the Amorites , which dwelt in that mountain , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and destroyed you in Seir , even unto Hormah .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the Lord spake unto me : and we compassed mount Seir many days .
and command thou the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore :
Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
for indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consumed .
so it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
and the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Azzah , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
let me pass through THY land : I will go along by the high way , I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river Jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
so the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people : and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .
and we took all his cities at that time , there was not a city which we took not from them , threescore cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ;
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
and unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
the plain also , and Jordan , and the coast thereof , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under Ashdoth @-@ pisgah eastward .
and I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings : so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest .
O Lord God , thou hast begun to shew THY servant THY greatness , and THY mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to THY works , and according to THY might ?
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal @-@ peor : for all the men that followed Baal @-@ peor , the Lord THY God hath destroyed them from among you .
but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day .
for what nation is there so great , who hath God so nigh unto them , as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for ?
and the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
and the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire :
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance :
and the Lord shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the Lord shall lead you .
but if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord THY God , thou shalt find him , if thou seek him with all THY heart and with all THY soul .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the Lord THY God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
( for the Lord THY God is a merciful God ; ) he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the Covenant of THY fathers which he sware unto them .
and because he loved THY fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ;
that the Slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
namely , Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , of the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which Moses spake unto the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
and they possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ;
and Moses called all Israel , and said unto them , Hear , O Israel , the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day , that ye may learn them , and keep , and do them .
the Lord made not this Covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to shew you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
Thou shalt not make thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the waters beneath the earth :
honour THY father and THY mother , as the Lord THY God hath commanded thee ; that THY days may be prolonged , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , then we shall die .
go thou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
now these are the commandments , the statutes , and the judgments , which the Lord your God commanded to teach you , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it :
and thou shalt love the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul , and with all THY might .
( for the Lord THY God is a Jealous God among you ) lest the anger of the Lord THY God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord sware unto THY fathers ,
and when THY son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What mean the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which the Lord our God hath commanded you ?
then thou shalt say unto THY son , We were Pharaoh 's bondmen in Egypt ; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand :
and the Lord shewed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
and the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear the Lord our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
and when the Lord THY God shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no Covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them :
neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; THY daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto THY son .
for they will turn away THY son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their Graven images with fire .
for thou art an holy people unto the Lord THY God : the Lord THY God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
the Lord did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people :
know therefore that the Lord THY God , he is God , the faithful God , which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ;
and repayeth them that hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be Slack to him that hateth him , he will repay him to his face .
and the Lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord THY God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
Thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember what the Lord THY God did unto Pharaoh , and unto all Egypt ;
moreover the Lord THY God will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from thee , be destroyed .
and the Lord THY God will put out those nations before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
all the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers .
a land of wheat , and barley , and vines , and fig trees , and pomegranates ; a land of oil olive , and honey ;
a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass .
when thou hast eaten and art full , then thou shalt bless the Lord THY God for the good land which he hath given thee .
beware that thou forget not the Lord THY God , in not keeping his commandments , and his judgments , and his statutes , which I command thee this day :
Lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ;
and when THY herds and THY flocks multiply , and THY silver and THY gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ;
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery Serpents , and Scorpions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of Flint ;
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which THY fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at THY latter end ;
but thou shalt remember the Lord THY God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his Covenant which he sware unto THY fathers , as it is this day .
as the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God .
a people great and tall , the children of the Anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the children of Anak !
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the Covenant were in my two hands .
and I took the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and brake them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you . but the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also .
thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights , as I fell down at the first ; because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
remember THY servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin :
and I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest , and thou shalt put them in the Ark .
and I made an Ark of shittim wood , and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first , and went up into the mount , having the two tables in mine hand .
and I turned myself and came down from the mount , and put the tables in the Ark which I had made ; and there they be , as the Lord commanded me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord 's THY God , the earth also , with all that therein is .
only the Lord had a delight in THY fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
for the Lord your God is God of gods , and Lord of lords , a great God , a mighty , and a terrible , which regardeth not persons , nor taketh reward :
he is THY praise , and he is THY God , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen .
therefore thou shalt love the Lord THY God , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his judgments , and his commandments , alway .
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
and that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
but the land , whither ye go to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven :
a land which the Lord THY God careth for : the eyes of the Lord THY God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in THY corn , and THY wine , and thine oil .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
a blessing , if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God , which I command you this day :
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord THY God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
for ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you , and ye shall possess it , and dwell therein .
these are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of THY fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the Lord THY God hath blessed thee .
Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes .
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which the Lord your God giveth you .
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of THY tribes , there thou shalt offer THY burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
only THY holy things which thou hast , and THY vows , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which the Lord shall choose :
when the Lord THY God shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land ;
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , whereof he spake unto thee , saying , Let us go after other gods , which thou hast not known , and let us serve them ;
Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams : for the Lord your God proveth you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
Thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him :
but thou shalt surely kill him ; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
then shalt thou inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought among you ;
Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
for thou art an holy people unto the Lord THY God , and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
the hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamois .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
and the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it is unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of their flesh , nor touch their dead carcase .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord THY God shall choose :
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within THY gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the Lord 's release .
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which is thine with THY brother thine hand shall release ;
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wanteth .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto THY brother , to THY poor , and to THY needy , in THY land .
and if THY brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
and when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of THY flock , and out of THY floor , and out of THY winepress : of that wherewith the Lord THY God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the Lord THY God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
and it shall be , if he say unto thee , I will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he is well with thee ;
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be THY servant for ever . and also unto THY maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
all the firstling males that come of THY herd and of THY flock thou shalt sanctify unto the Lord THY God : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of THY bullock , nor shear the firstling of THY sheep .
Thou shalt eat it before the Lord THY God year by year in the place which the Lord shall choose , thou and THY household .
and if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the Lord THY God .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the passover unto the Lord THY God : for in the month of Abib the Lord THY God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night .
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord THY God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord THY God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto THY tents .
six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord THY God : thou shalt do no work therein .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of the Lord THY God which he hath given thee .
judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all THY gates , which the Lord THY God giveth thee , throughout THY tribes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
Thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect persons , neither take a gift : for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the Lord THY God , which thou shalt make thee .
Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord THY God any bullock , or sheep , wherein is blemish , or any evilfavouredness : for that is an abomination unto the Lord THY God .
if there be found among you , within any of THY gates which the Lord THY God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord THY God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
and hath gone and served other gods , and worshipped them , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heaven , which I have not commanded ;
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
the priests the Levites , and all the tribe of Levi , shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel : they shall eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and his inheritance .
the firstfruit also of THY corn , of THY wine , and of thine oil , and the first of the Fleece of THY sheep , shalt thou give him .
and if a Levite come from any of THY gates out of all Israel , where he sojourned , and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the Lord shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God , as all his brethren the Levites do , which stand there before the Lord .
when thou art come into the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord : and because of these abominations the Lord THY God doth drive them out from before thee .
for these nations , which thou shalt possess , hearkened unto observers of times , and unto diviners : but as for thee , the Lord THY God hath not suffered thee so to do .
the Lord THY God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , of THY brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ;
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
when the Lord THY God hath cut off the nations , whose land the Lord THY God giveth thee , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their cities , and in their houses ;
but if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities :
Thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with thee .
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before the Lord , before the priests and the judges , which shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent Inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and hath testified falsely against his brother ;
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
and it shall be , when ye are come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
and when the Lord THY God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the Lord THY God hath commanded thee :
if one be found slain in the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee to possess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hath slain him :
then THY elders and THY judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
and it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer 's neck there in the valley :
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley :
be merciful , O Lord , unto THY people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto THY people of Israel 's charge . and the blood shall be forgiven them .
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies , and the Lord THY God hath delivered them into thine hands , and thou hast taken them captive ,
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto her , that thou wouldest have her to THY wife ;
then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , which is indeed the firstborn :
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
Thou shalt not see THY brother 's ass or his ox fall down by the way , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again .
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord THY God .
but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go , and take the young to thee ; that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest prolong THY days .
Thou shalt not sow THY vineyard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of THY seed which thou hast sown , and the fruit of THY vineyard , be defiled .
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a maid :
then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel 's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her : then the man only that lay with her shall die :
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
if a man find a damsel that is a virgin , which is not betrothed , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse thee .
nevertheless the Lord THY God would not hearken unto Balaam ; but the Lord THY God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because the Lord THY God loved thee .
but it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
and thou shalt have a paddle upon THY weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :
he shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of THY gates , where it liketh him best : thou shalt not oppress him .
that which is gone out of THY lips thou shalt keep and perform ; even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord THY God , which thou hast promised with THY mouth .
when thou comest into THY neighbour 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes THY fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in THY vessel .
and when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man 's wife .
if a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel , and maketh merchandise of him , or selleth him ; then that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from among you .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so ye shall observe to do .
Thou shalt stand abroad , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord THY God .
Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy , whether he be of THY brethren , or of THY strangers that are in THY land within THY gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and the Lord THY God redeemed thee thence : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
when thou gatherest the grapes of THY vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
and it shall be , that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
how he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
and the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the Lord THY God .
and when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers , the Lord heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression :
and the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terribleness , and with signs , and with wonders :
and he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , even a land that floweth with milk and honey .
and now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O Lord , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the Lord THY God , and worship before the Lord THY God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord THY God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
look down from THY holy habitation , from heaven , and bless THY people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
this day the Lord THY God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all THY soul .
and the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people , as he hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments ;
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
and there shalt thou build an altar unto the Lord THY God , an altar of stones : thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them .
Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord THY God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord THY God :
Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord THY God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
and all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God .
blessed shall be the fruit of THY body , and the fruit of THY ground , and the fruit of THY cattle , the increase of THY kine , and the flocks of THY sheep .
the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before THY face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in THY storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee .
the Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord THY God , and walk in his ways .
and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
Cursed shall be the fruit of THY body , and the fruit of THY land , the increase of THY kine , and the flocks of THY sheep .
the Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
and THY heaven that is over THY head shall be brass , and the earth that is under thee shall be iron .
the Lord shall make the rain of THY land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
and THY carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air , and unto the beasts of the earth , and no man shall fray them away .
the Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt , and with the emerods , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be healed .
and thou shalt grope at noonday , as the blind gropeth in darkness , and thou shalt not prosper in THY ways : and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore , and no man shall save thee .
Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
THY sons and THY daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
the fruit of THY land , and all THY labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
the Lord shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that cannot be healed , from the sole of THY foot unto the top of THY head .
Thou shalt plant vineyards , and dress them , but shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grapes ; for the worms shall eat them .
the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high ; and thou shalt come down very low .
because thou servedst not the Lord THY God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all things ;
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , the Lord THY God ;
then the Lord will make THY plagues wonderful , and the plagues of THY seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and sore sicknesses , and of long continuance .
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the Lord bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord THY God .
and the Lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor THY fathers have known , even wood and stone .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of THY foot have rest : but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
these are the words of the Covenant , which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , beside the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
and Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
and I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes are not waxen old upon you , and THY shoe is not waxen old upon THY foot .
and when ye came unto this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us unto battle , and we smote them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half tribe of Manasseh .
that thou shouldest enter into Covenant with the Lord THY God , and into his oath , which the Lord THY God maketh with thee this day :
and the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the Covenant that are written in this book of the law :
then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
and the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the Lord THY God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the Lord THY God will bring thee into the land which THY fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above THY fathers .
and the Lord THY God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of THY seed , to love the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul , that thou mayest live .
neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word is very nigh unto thee , in THY mouth , and in THY heart , that thou mayest do it .
but if thine heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
I denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land , whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it .
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord THY God , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nations from before thee , and thou shalt possess them : and Joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the Lord hath said .
and the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og , kings of the Amorites , and unto the land of them , whom he destroyed .
and the Lord shall give them up before your face , that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the Lord THY God , he it is that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
and the Lord , he it is that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and unto all the elders of Israel .
and Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacles ,
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord THY God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
and the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud : and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle .
and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
and it came to pass , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
take this book of the law , and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God , that it may be there for a witness against thee .
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to record against them .
and Moses spake in the ears of all the Congregation of Israel the words of this song , until they were ended .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations : ask THY father , and he will shew thee ; THY elders , and they will tell thee .
for the Lord 's portion is his people ; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
he found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
but Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
and he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
for a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
I said , I would scatter them into corners , I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men :
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , and of the fields of Gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter :
to me belongeth vengeance , and recompence ; their foot shall slide in due time : for the day of their calamity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make haste .
for the Lord shall judge his people , and repent himself for his servants , when he seeth that their power is gone , and there is none shut up , or left .
if I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives , from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy .
and Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and Hoshea the son of nun .
for it is not a vain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land , whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
and die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto THY people ; as Aaron THY brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people :
because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah @-@ Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
and this is the blessing , wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
Yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in THY hand : and they sat down at THY feet ; every one shall receive of THY words .
and of Joseph he said , blessed of the Lord be his land , for the precious things of heaven , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ,
they shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand .
and Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . and the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead , unto Dan ,
and the south , and the plain of the valley of Jericho , the city of palm trees , unto Zoar .
and he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab , over against Beth @-@ peor : but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day .
now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' minister , saying ,
Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give them .
have not I commanded thee ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the Lord THY God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , saying , The Lord your God hath given you rest , and hath given you this land .
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
then she let them down by a cord through the window : for her house was upon the town wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
and if thou utter this our business , then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
and they went , and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days , until the pursuers were returned : and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
so the two men returned , and descended from the mountain , and passed over , and came to Joshua the son of nun , and told him all things that befell them :
and Joshua rose early in the morning ; and they removed from Shittim , and came to Jordan , he and all the children of Israel , and lodged there before they passed over .
and they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Joshua spake unto the priests , saying , Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ark of the Covenant , and went before the people .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and it came to pass , when the people removed from their tents , to pass over Jordan , and the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people ;
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over Jordan , that the Lord spake unto Joshua , saying ,
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the Ark of the Covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
and the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spake unto them :
and the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , in the east border of Jericho .
now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Joshua circumcised : for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them by the way .
and it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole .
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cakes , and parched corn in the selfsame day .
and ye shall compass the city , all ye men of war , and go round about the city once . thus shalt thou do six days .
and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets , and the rereward came after the Ark , the priests going on , and blowing with the trumpets .
so the Ark of the Lord compassed the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , Joshua said unto the people , shout ; for the Lord hath given you the city .
and ye , in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselves accursed , when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of Israel a curse , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are consecrated unto the Lord : they shall come into the treasury of the Lord .
but Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country , Go into the harlot 's house , and bring out thence the woman , and all that she hath , as ye sware unto her .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
and Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day ; because she hid the messengers , which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
and Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the eventide , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
and he brought the family of Judah ; and he took the family of the Zarhites : and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man ; and Zabdi was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
so Joshua sent messengers , and they ran unto the tent ; and , behold , it was hid in his tent , and the silver under it .
and they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them unto Joshua , and unto all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against AI : and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night .
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have commanded you .
and all the people that were in AI were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and there was not a man left in AI or Bethel , that went not out after Israel : and they left the city open , and pursued after Israel .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
and when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and slew the men of AI .
and so it was , that all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of AI .
for Joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of AI .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the Lord which he commanded Joshua .
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
and afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessings and cursings , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites , that were beyond Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , which was at Ashtaroth .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt among them .
and the children of Israel journeyed , and came unto their cities on the third day . now their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjath @-@ jearim .
and the children of Israel smote them not , because the princes of the Congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel . and all the Congregation murmured against the princes .
this we will do to them ; we will even let them live , lest wrath be upon us , because of the oath which we sware unto them .
and Joshua called for them , and he spake unto them , saying , Wherefore have ye beguiled us , saying , We are very far from you ; when ye dwell among us ?
now therefore ye are Cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood and Drawers of water for the house of my God .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
so Joshua ascended from Gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valour .
and the Lord discomfited them before Israel , and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth @-@ horon , and smote them to Azekah , and unto Makkedah .
and stay ye not , but pursue after your enemies , and smite the hindmost of them ; suffer them not to enter into their cities : for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand .
and it came to pass , when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west ,
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them : there was not any left to breathe : and he burnt Hazor with fire .
as the Lord commanded Moses his servant , so did Moses command Joshua , and so did Joshua ; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses .
there was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .
and the coast of Og king of Bashan , which was of the remnant of the giants , that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
them did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
the king of Dor in the coast of Dor , one ; the king of the nations of Gilgal , one ;
from the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians , unto Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites :
from Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon ;
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites , nor the Maachathites : but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .
and their coast was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them .
and the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan , and the border thereof . this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
and Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh : and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families .
and their coast was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities :
these are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab , on the other side Jordan , by Jericho , eastward .
forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh @-@ barnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward :
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :
and the border went up to Beth @-@ hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth @-@ arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast thereof . this is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
Ashdod with her towns and her villages , Gaza with her towns and her villages , unto the river of Egypt , and the great sea , and the border thereof :
as for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah could not drive them out : but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day .
and the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho , unto the water of Jericho on the east , to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel ,
and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti , unto the coast of Beth @-@ horon the nether , and to Gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the sea .
and the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth @-@ addar , unto Beth @-@ horon the upper ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth , and to Naarath , and came to Jericho , and went out at Jordan .
the border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah ; and the goings out thereof were at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
and the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
and the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah , that lieth before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En @-@ tappuah .
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in Asher on the north , and in Issachar on the east .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute ; but did not utterly drive them out .
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh , and set up the tabernacle of the Congregation there . and the land was subdued before them .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the description hither to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord : and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions .
and the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @-@ hoglah northward : and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
and Jordan was the border of it on the east side . this was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin , by the coasts thereof round about , according to their families .
now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Beth @-@ hoglah , and the valley of Keziz ,
and Zelah , Eleph , and Jebusi , which is Jerusalem , Gibeath , and Kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and the second lot came forth to Simeon , even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families : and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath @-@ beer , Ramath of the south . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
and their border went up toward the sea , and Maralah , and reached to Dabbasheth , and reached to the river that is before Jokneam ;
and the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon : and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthah @-@ el :
and the coast reacheth to Tabor , and Shahazimah , and Beth @-@ shemesh ; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities and their villages .
and then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib :
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali , even for the children of Naphtali according to their families .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families , the cities and their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
when they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts , the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of nun among them :
according to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnath @-@ serah in mount Ephraim : and he built the city , and dwelt therein .
the Lord also spake unto Joshua , saying ,
and the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the Lord , these cities and their suburbs .
and the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh , ten cities .
the children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben , and out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun , twelve cities .
and they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi , had : for theirs was the first lot .
but the fields of the city , and the villages thereof , gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Libnah with her suburbs ,
and Ain with her suburbs , and Juttah with her suburbs , and Beth @-@ shemesh with her suburbs ; nine cities out of those two tribes .
and out of the tribe of Benjamin , Gibeon with her suburbs , Geba with her suburbs ,
and the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
and unto the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with her suburbs , and Kartah with her suburbs ,
so all the cities for the children of Merari by their families , which were remaining of the families of the Levites , were by their lot twelve cities .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
and with him ten princes , of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel ; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel .
and they came unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , unto the land of Gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the Congregation of the Lord ,
then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered , and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age .
and ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you .
and the Lord your God , he shall expel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the Lord your God hath promised unto you .
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
for the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand : for the Lord your God , he it is that fighteth for you , as he hath promised you .
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
and I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and ye came unto the sea ; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea .
and it came to pass after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath @-@ serah , which is in mount Ephraim , on the north side of the hill of Gaash .
and Judah went up ; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand : and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men .
now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem , and had taken it , and smitten it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and the Lord was with Judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day .
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city , they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
and the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called the name thereof Luz : which is the name thereof unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho , nor the inhabitants of Zidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob :
but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
and the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley :
but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became tributaries .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars : but ye have not obeyed my voice : why have ye done this ?
Wherefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you .
and it came to pass , when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
and Joshua the son of nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath @-@ heres , in the mount of Ephraim , on the north side of the hill Gaash .
and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , which knew not the Lord , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel .
Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for evil , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
nevertheless the Lord raised up judges , which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and he said , Because that this people hath transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not hearkened unto my voice ;
that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal @-@ hermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and forgat the Lord their God , and served Baalim and the groves .
therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Chushan @-@ rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel served Chushan @-@ rishathaim eight years .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the Lord delivered Chushan @-@ rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushan @-@ rishathaim .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
and when he had made an end to offer the present , he sent away the people that bare the present .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly :
and the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
and they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour ; and there escaped not a man .
and Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
and the Lord discomfited Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his host , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
but Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the host , unto Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword ; and there was not a man left .
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
and he said unto her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . and she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
and the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
hear , O ye kings ; give ear , O ye princes ; I , even I , will sing unto the Lord ; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel .
Lord , when thou wentest out of Seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
in the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied , and the travellers walked through byways .
then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people : the Lord made me have dominion over the mighty .
out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among THY people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
she put her hand to the nail , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer ; and with the hammer she smote Sisera , she smote off his head , when she had pierced and stricken through his temples .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel : and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and caves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
and it came to pass , when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites ,
that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said unto you , I am the Lord your God ; fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord , Gideon said , Alas , O Lord God ! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face .
and build an altar unto the Lord THY God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
but the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and Abi @-@ ezer was gathered after him .
and it was so : for he rose up early on the morrow , and thrust the Fleece together , and wringed the dew out of the Fleece , a bowl full of water .
and the Lord said unto Gideon , The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands , lest Israel vaunt themselves against me , saying , Mine own hand hath saved me .
and the number of them that lapped , putting their hand to their mouth , were three hundred men : but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water .
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host . then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man 's hand , with empty pitchers , and lamps within the pitchers .
when I blow with a trumpet , I and all that are with me , then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and say , The sword of the Lord , and of Gideon .
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp : and all the host ran , and cried , and fled .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after the Midianites .
and Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and smote the host : for the host was secure .
and caught a young man of the men of Succoth , and inquired of him : and he described unto him the princes of Succoth , and the elders thereof , even threescore and seventeen men .
and he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
then the men of Israel said unto Gideon , Rule thou over us , both thou , and THY son , and THY son 's son also : for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian .
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abi @-@ ezrites .
and it came to pass , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a whoring after Baalim , and made Baal @-@ berith their god .
and the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal @-@ berith , wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons , which followed him .
and all the men of Shechem gathered together , and all the house of Millo , and went , and made Abimelech king , by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem .
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ;
if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice ye in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you :
and Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and dwelt there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
and Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren , and went over to Shechem : and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
and when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
and he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily , saying , behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem ; and , behold , they fortify the city against thee .
now therefore up by night , thou and the people that is with thee , and lie in wait in the field :
and Abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
and Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
and Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and slew the people that was therein , and beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
and when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that , they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith .
and it was told Abimelech , that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and thither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and gat them up to the top of the tower .
and Abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts , and they had thirty cities , which are called Havoth @-@ jair unto this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines , and into the hands of the children of Ammon .
moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was sore distressed .
and the Lord said unto the children of Israel , did not I deliver you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
the Zidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , did oppress you ; and ye cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
and the children of Israel said unto the Lord , We have sinned : do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee ; deliver us only , we pray thee , this day .
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . and the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpeh .
and the people and princes of Gilead said one to another , What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
and it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob :
and Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight in my land ?
and Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said unto him , Let us pass , we pray thee , through THY land into my place .
Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh THY god giveth thee to possess ? so whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us , them will we possess .
and now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
and Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house , and , behold , his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances : and she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .
and Jephthah judged Israel six years . then died Jephthah the Gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead .
and there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not .
and God hearkened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah her husband was not with her .
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that I commanded her let her observe .
and Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord , I pray thee , let us detain thee , until we shall have made ready a kid for thee .
so Manoah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord : and the angel did wondrously ; and Manoah and his wife looked on .
but the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife . then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnath , and came to the vineyards of Timnath : and , behold , a young lion roared against him .
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam .
and he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand , and called that place Ramath @-@ lehi .
and Samson said unto her , If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
but the Philistines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he did grind in the prison house .
then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god , and to rejoice : for they said , Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand , suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth , that I may lean upon them .
in those days there was no king in Israel , but every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he journeyed .
and the Levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons .
and Micah consecrated the Levite ; and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
and they said unto him , Ask counsel , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
when ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure , and to a large land : for God hath given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth .
and there went from thence of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men appointed with weapons of war .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and the priest 's heart was glad , and he took the ephod , and the teraphim , and the Graven image , and went in the midst of the people .
and the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first .
and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart : and the damsel 's father said , Comfort thine heart , I pray thee . and they tarried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
and when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , Come , I pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gibeah .
and they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah , which belongeth to Benjamin .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man said , Whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , till it was light .
and he said unto her , Up , and let us be going . but none answered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and gat him unto his place .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Congregation was gathered together as one man , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , with the land of Gilead , unto the Lord in Mizpeh .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword .
and the Levite , the husband of the woman that was slain , answered and said , I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
and I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel : for they have committed lewdness and Folly in Israel .
and all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah ; we will go up by lot against it ;
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah .
and the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again Eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
and the liers in wait hasted , and rushed upon Gibeah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait , that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them , and , behold , the flame of the city ascended up to heaven .
and when the men of Israel turned again , the men of Benjamin were amazed : for they saw that evil was come upon them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
and the people came to the house of God , and abode there till even before God , and lifted up their voices , and wept sore ;
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
for the people were numbered , and , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead there .
and they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
and the whole Congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon , and to call peaceably unto them .
and they said , There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin .
and the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
and Naomi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother 's house : the Lord deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
the Lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . and it came to pass , when they were come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Naomi ?
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said unto the reapers , The Lord be with you . and they answered him , The Lord bless thee .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
and it came to pass at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned himself : and , behold , a woman lay at his feet .
and he said unto the kinsman , Naomi , that is come again out of the country of Moab , selleth a parcel of land , which was our brother Elimelech 's :
and let THY house be like the house of Pharez , whom Tamar bare unto Judah , of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman .
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of THY life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for THY daughter in law , which loveth thee , which is better to thee than seven sons , hath born him .
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
and when the time was that Elkanah offered , he gave to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and her daughters , portions :
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the Lord , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord .
Wherefore it came to pass , when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived , that she bare a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Because I have asked him of the Lord .
talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth : for the Lord is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
they that were full have hired out themselves for bread ; and they that were hungry ceased : so that the barren hath born seven ; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble .
moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
now Eli was very old , and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of THY father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon THY two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of them .
and it came to pass at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wax dim , that he could not see ;
and ERE the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord , where the Ark of God was , and Samuel was laid down to sleep ;
and the Lord said to Samuel , behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
in that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
and the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and when the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
and the Philistines were afraid , for they said , God is come into the camp . and they said , Woe unto us ! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore .
Woe unto us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness .
and the Philistines fought , and Israel was smitten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
and there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent , and with earth upon his head .
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her , Fear not ; for thou hast born a son . but she answered not , neither did she regard it .
when the Philistines took the Ark of God , they brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
and when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the Ark of the Lord . and they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
and when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , The Ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us : for his hand is sore upon us , and upon Dagon our god .
and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods : and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
and the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , What shall we do to the Ark of the Lord ? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place .
Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts , as the Egyptians and Pharoah hardened their hearts ? when he had wrought wonderfully among them , did they not let the people go , and they departed ?
now therefore make a new cart , and take two milch kine , on which there hath come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring their calves home from them :
and they laid the Ark of the Lord upon the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods .
and they of Beth @-@ shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
and these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord ; for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Askelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
and the men of Kirjath @-@ jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of the Lord , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of the Lord .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
and the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh , and pursued the Philistines , and smote them , until they came under Beth @-@ car .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
and it came to pass , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abiah : they were judges in Beer @-@ sheba .
and the Lord said unto Samuel , Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
and he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
( Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he spake , Come , and let us go to the seer : for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer . )
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons .
and when they were come down from the high place into the city , Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house .
and let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for God is with thee .
and Saul said unto his uncle , He told us plainly that the asses were found . but of the matter of the kingdom , whereof Samuel spake , he told him not .
when he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
and they ran and fetched him thence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul , and told the tidings in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and wept .
and Samuel said unto the people , It is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord , which he did to you and to your fathers .
when Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
and when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , ye said unto me , Nay ; but a king shall reign over us : when the Lord your God was your king .
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired ! and , behold , the Lord hath set a king over you .
but if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which cannot profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake : because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead . as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
and Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord THY God , which he commanded thee : for now would the Lord have established THY kingdom upon Israel for ever .
and Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , abode in Gibeah of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
and the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah , unto the land of Shual :
and Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , behold , the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves .
and that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
and the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked ; and , behold , the multitude melted away , and they went on beating down one another .
and Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
how much more , if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found ? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines ?
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
and there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any strong man , or any valiant man , he took him unto him .
Samuel also said unto Saul , The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people , over Israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord .
and he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
and Samuel said unto him , The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day , and hath given it to a neighbour of thine , that is better than thou .
and Samuel said , As THY sword hath made women childless , so shall THY mother be childless among women . and Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal .
then Samuel took the Horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pitched by the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
and the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul .
and the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
and David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
and all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were sore afraid .
and he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
and when the words were heard which David spake , they rehearsed them before Saul : and he sent for him .
and Saul said to David , Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
and Saul armed David with his armour , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
and the Philistine came on and drew near unto David ; and the man that bare the shield went before him .
and when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
and the Philistine said to David , Come to me , and I will give THY flesh unto the fowls of the air , and to the beasts of the field .
and it came to pass , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew nigh to meet David , that David hasted , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
and as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
and when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son in law : and the days were not expired .
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was much set by .
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
and Michal took an image , and laid it in the bed , and put a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster , and covered it with a cloth .
and when the messengers were come in , behold , there was an image in the bed , with a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster .
and he went thither to Naioth in Ramah : and the Spirit of God was upon him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
and thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the Lord , that I die not :
but also thou shalt not cut off THY kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
and when thou hast stayed three days , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground , thou shalt not be established , nor THY kingdom . Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me , for he shall surely die .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the lad , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
and Jonathan cried after the lad , Make speed , haste , stay not . and Jonathan 's lad gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Doeg , an Edomite , the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul .
David therefore departed thence , and escaped to the cave Adullam : and when his brethren and all his father 's house heard it , they went down thither to him .
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests that were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
so David and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their cattle , and smote them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
and it came to pass , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
and David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life : and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood .
then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
now therefore , O king , come down according to all the desire of THY soul to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king 's hand .
go , I pray you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his haunt is , and who hath seen him there : for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly .
and they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the plain on the south of Jeshimon .
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , behold , David is in the wilderness of En @-@ gedi .
and he came to the sheepcotes by the way , where was a cave ; and Saul went in to cover his feet : and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave .
and it came to pass afterward , that David 's heart smote him , because he had cut off Saul 's skirt .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . but Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also arose afterward , and went out of the cave , and cried after Saul , saying , My lord the king . and when Saul looked behind him , David stooped with his face to the earth , and bowed himself .
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
for if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day .
and now , behold , I know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand .
swear now therefore unto me by the Lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said unto the young men , Get you up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name :
and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity , Peace be both to thee , and peace be to thine house , and peace be unto all that thou hast .
and now I have heard that thou hast shearers : now THY shepherds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing unto them , all the while they were in Carmel .
and when David 's young men came , they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers , and give it unto men , whom I know not whence they be ?
they were a wall unto us both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
and when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel , they spake unto her , saying , David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
and Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , by the way . but David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
and he said , Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in mine hand ?
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains .
the Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness : for the Lord delivered thee into my hand to day , but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's anointed .
and , behold , as THY life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
and David arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish , the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
and David dwelt with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
and the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . and Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
and when Saul saw the host of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly trembled .
and when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice : and the woman spake to Saul , saying , Why hast thou deceived me ? for thou art Saul .
now therefore , I pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on THY way .
and the woman had a fat calf in the house ; and she hasted , and killed it , and took flour , and kneaded it , and did bake unleavened bread thereof :
and the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands : but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , Saul slew his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with THY master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
so David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
we made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites , and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah , and upon the south of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire .
and there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil , nor any thing that they had taken to them : David recovered all .
and to them which were in Hormah , and to them which were in Chor @-@ ashan , and to them which were in Athach ,
and the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi @-@ shua , Saul 's sons .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
and they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth : and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth @-@ Shan .
now it came to pass after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had abode two days in Ziklag ;
then David took hold on his clothes , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him :
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
( also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jasher . )
from the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of Jonathan turned not back , and the sword of Saul returned not empty .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan : very pleasant hast thou been unto me : THY love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
and the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . and they told David , saying , That the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead were they that buried Saul .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead , and said unto them , blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye valiant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them .
but Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's host , took Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and there was a very sore battle that day ; and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
and Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah , that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
and the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of an hill .
and Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
and they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : but David waxed stronger and stronger , and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul .
and Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
so Abner came to David to Hebron , and twenty men with him . and David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast .
Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know THY going out and THY coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
and they buried Abner in Hebron : and the king lifted up his voice , and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
THY hands were not bound , nor THY feet put into fetters : as a man falleth before wicked men , so fellest thou . and all the people wept again over him .
for all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner .
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
and David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel 's sake .
but when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the hold .
and they set the Ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
and when they came to Nachon 's threshingfloor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the Ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah ; and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the Ark of God .
and David was displeased , because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzzah : and he called the name of the place Perez @-@ uzzah to this day .
so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite .
and the Ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite three months : and the Lord blessed Obed @-@ edom , and all his household .
and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David , Michal Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and she despised him in her heart .
and as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts .
and it came to pass , when the king sat in his house , and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies ;
and it came to pass that night , that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan , saying ,
whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of THY sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and when THY days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with THY fathers , I will set up THY seed after thee , which shall proceed out of THY bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
but my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
for THY word 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all these great things , to make THY servant know them .
Wherefore thou art great , O Lord God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
and now , O Lord God , the word that thou hast spoken concerning THY servant , and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as thou hast said .
and after this it came to pass , that David smote the Philistines , and subdued them : and David took Metheg @-@ ammah out of the hand of the Philistines .
David smote also Hadadezer , the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates .
and David took from him a thousand chariots , and seven hundred horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : and David houghed all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for an hundred chariots .
and when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah , David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
and David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
and David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt , being Eighteen thousand men .
and he put garrisons in Edom ; throughout all Edom put he garrisons , and all they of Edom became David 's servants . and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Seraiah was the scribe ;
and Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Micha . and all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth .
and it came to pass after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his stead .
Wherefore Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
when Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the Lord do that which seemeth him good .
and Joab drew nigh , and the people that were with him , unto the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
and Hadarezer sent , and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river : and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to Helam . and the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
and David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her ; for she was purified from her uncleanness : and she returned unto her house .
and when Uriah was come unto him , David demanded of him how Joab did , and how the people did , and how the war prospered .
and David said to Uriah , Go down to THY house , and wash THY feet . and Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
and he wrote in the letter , saying , Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten , and die .
and it came to pass , when Joab observed the city , that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were .
and the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab : and there fell some of the people of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon THY servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and THY servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also .
and Nathan departed unto his house . and the Lord struck the child that Uriah 's wife bare unto David , and it was very sick .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then said his servants unto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ? thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
and it came to pass after this , that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tamar ; and Amnon the son of David loved her .
but Amnon had a friend , whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David 's brother : and Jonadab was a very subtil man .
and she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and Amnon said , Have out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and Amnon said unto Tamar , Bring the meat into the chamber , that I may eat of thine hand . and Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on crying .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead : for Amnon only is dead .
but Absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and THY handmaid had two sons , and they two strove together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other , and slew him .
for the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
to fetch about this form of speech hath THY servant Joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
and unto Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a fair countenance .
therefore Absalom sent for Joab , to have sent him to the king ; but he would not come to him : and when he sent again the second time , he would not come .
so Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
and it was so , that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and kissed him .
and on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
and with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem , that were called ; and they went in their simplicity , and they knew not any thing .
and the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tarried in a place that was far off .
and all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men which came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
and all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
but if he thus say , I have no delight in thee ; behold , here am I , let him do to me as seemeth good unto him .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
and hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's son , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction , and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day .
and as David and his men went by the way , Shimei went along on the hill 's side over against him , and Cursed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
and it came to pass , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , was come unto Absalom , that Hushai said unto Absalom , God save the king , God save the king .
and again , whom should I serve ? should I not serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in THY father 's presence , so will I be in THY presence .
so they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house ; and Absalom went in unto his father 's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will smite the king only :
and he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that THY father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
then David arose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over Jordan : by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan .
and Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab : which Amasa was a man 's son , whose name was Ithra an Israelite , that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Joab 's mother .
otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life : for there is no matter hid from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me .
and they took Absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
and the watchman cried , and told the king . and the king said , If he be alone , there is tidings in his mouth . and he came Apace , and drew near .
and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people : for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son .
and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city , as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
so the king returned , and came to Jordan . and Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
for THY servant doth know that I have sinned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , Wherefore wentest not thou with me , Mephibosheth ?
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old : and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
then the king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him : and all the people of Judah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
so Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah : but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
and there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men : and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
and he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel , and to Beth @-@ maachah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then she spake , saying , They were wont to speak in old time , saying , They shall surely ask counsel at Abel : and so they ended the matter .
now Joab was over all the host of Israel : and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites :
and it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son ; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged .
moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Philistines : and David waxed faint .
and it came to pass after this , that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph , which was of the sons of the giant .
and there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaare @-@ oregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
I will call on the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
and he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : and he was seen upon the wings of the wind .
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the rebuking of the Lord , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
for all his judgments were before me : and as for his statutes , I did not depart from them .
and the afflicted people thou wilt save : but thine eyes are upon the haughty , that thou mayest bring them down .
as for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the Lord is tried : he is a buckler to all them that trust in him .
and I have consumed them , and wounded them , that they could not arise : yea , they are fallen under my feet .
then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth , I did stamp them as the mire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people , thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen : a people which I knew not shall serve me .
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of Jesse said , and the man who was raised up on high , the anointed of the God of Jacob , and the sweet psalmist of Israel , said ,
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spake to me , He that ruleth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without clouds ; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain .
but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear ; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place .
and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam : and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
Heleb the son of Baanah , a Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin ,
so when they had gone through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
and Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
now therefore come , let me , I pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life , and the life of THY son Solomon .
behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , I also will come in after thee , and confirm THY words .
and Bath @-@ sheba went in unto the king into the chamber : and the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders .
and they told the king , saying , behold Nathan the prophet . and when he was come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
but me , even me THY servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and THY servant Solomon , hath he not called .
the king also said unto them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to Gihon :
and all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
and also thus said the king , blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and Adonijah feared because of Solomon , and arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
now the days of David drew nigh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
now therefore hold him not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him ; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
and the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
then tidings came to Joab : for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he turned not after Absalom . and Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
so Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell upon him , and slew him : and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
and the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host : and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the Brook Kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : THY blood shall be upon thine own head .
and it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and was come again .
the king said moreover to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou didst to David my father : therefore the Lord shall return THY wickedness upon thine own head ;
and the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place : a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar .
and now , O Lord my God , thou hast made THY servant king instead of David my father : and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or come in .
and THY servant is in the midst of THY people which thou hast chosen , a great people , that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all THY days .
and she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while thine handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
then said the king , The one saith , This is my son that liveth , and THY son is the dead : and the other saith , Nay ; but THY son is the dead , and my son is the living .
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers : and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer , and the king 's friend :
Baana the son of Ahilud ; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth @-@ shean , which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel , from Beth @-@ shean to Abel @-@ meholah , even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam :
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
and Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines , and unto the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea shore .
and Solomon 's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country , and all the wisdom of Egypt .
for he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Chalcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all nations round about .
and Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil : thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year .
beside the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that wrought in the work .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length thereof was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits .
and the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he made chambers round about :
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
and the oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
and the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid , in the month Zif :
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other .
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this porch .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
and nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of Lily work in the porch , four cubits .
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter .
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and he called the name thereof Boaz .
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and it was an hand breadth thick , and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies : it contained two thousand baths .
and he made ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits the breadth thereof , and three cubits the height of it .
and the work of the bases was on this manner : they had borders , and the borders were between the ledges :
and every base had four brasen wheels , and plates of brass : and the four corners thereof had undersetters : under the laver were undersetters molten , at the side of every addition .
and under the borders were four wheels ; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit .
and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axletrees , and their naves , and their felloes , and their spokes , were all molten .
and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base : and the undersetters were of the very base itself .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
then made he ten lavers of brass : one laver contained forty baths : and every laver was four cubits : and upon every one of the ten bases one laver .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and Hiram made the lavers , and the shovels , and the basons . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the Lord :
and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , even two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basons : and all these vessels , which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord , were of bright brass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was ,
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ark of the Lord , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled unto him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen , that could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the Ark , and the cherubims covered the Ark and the staves thereof above .
and they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud : for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord .
and the king turned his face about , and blessed all the Congregation of Israel : ( and all the Congregation of Israel stood ; )
and he said , blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which spake with his mouth unto David my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
and the Lord said unto David my father , whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name , thou didst well that it was in thine heart .
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but THY son that shall come forth out of THY loins , he shall build the house unto my name .
and I have set there a place for the Ark , wherein is the Covenant of the Lord , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
and Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the Congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
who hast kept with THY servant David my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
and now , O God of Israel , let THY word , I pray thee , be verified , which thou spakest unto THY servant David my father .
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of THY servant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which THY servant prayeth before thee to day :
when THY people Israel be smitten down before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee , and shall turn again to thee , and confess THY name , and pray , and make supplication unto thee in this house :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of THY people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers .
when heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess THY name , and turn from their sin , when thou afflictest them :
that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
moreover concerning a stranger , that is not of THY people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for THY name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of THY great name , and of THY strong hand , and of THY stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
if THY people go out to battle against their enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for THY name :
and forgive THY people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them :
for they be THY people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of THY servant , and unto the supplication of THY people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
blessed be the Lord , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day .
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then I will establish the throne of THY kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David THY father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
and at this house , which is high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
and Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they pleased him not .
for Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the people that were left of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy , upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
these were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fifty , which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work .
and king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion @-@ geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of Edom .
and Hiram sent in the navy his servants , shipmen that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
Howbeit I believed not the words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the half was not told me : THY wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard .
and the navy also of Hiram , that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees , and precious stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold .
beside that he had of the merchantmen , and of the traffick of the spice merchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the governors of the country .
the throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the stays .
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and garments , and armour , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale , for abundance .
and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh , the abomination of Moab , in the hill that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech , the abomination of the children of Ammon .
Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to THY son for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen .
for it came to pass , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain , after he had smitten every male in Edom ;
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt ; Hadad being yet a little child .
and Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
and the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house : and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's household among the sons of Pharaoh .
and when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
and he gathered men unto him , and became captain over a band , when David slew them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and dwelt therein , and reigned in Damascus .
and Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephrathite of Zereda , Solomon 's servant , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father .
and the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious , he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
( but he shall have one tribe for my servant David 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel : )
but I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand , and will give it unto thee , even ten tribes .
and unto his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
and I will take thee , and thou shalt reign according to all that THY soul desireth , and shalt be king over Israel .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam . and Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , unto Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
and the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ; )
that they sent and called him . and Jeroboam and all the Congregation of Israel came , and spake unto Rehoboam , saying ,
but he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and he said unto them , What counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Make the yoke which THY father did put upon us lighter ?
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the tribute ; and all Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and he made an house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of Levi .
and , behold , there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethel : and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense .
the altar also was rent , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord , saying , eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
for it was said to me by the word of the Lord , Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest .
and it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back :
and it came to pass , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
and this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the face of the earth .
him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the Lord hath spoken it .
and they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet .
and the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
and Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed , above all that their fathers had done .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem :
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
and king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
and it was so , when the king went into the house of the Lord , that the guard bare them , and brought them back into the guard chamber .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
now the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? and there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
and forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
and Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
and it came to pass , when Baasha heard thereof , that he left off building of Ramah , and dwelt in Tirzah .
and he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
and Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon .
because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
behold , I will take away the posterity of Baasha , and the posterity of his house ; and will make THY house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat .
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him , as he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah .
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and the people that were encamped heard say , Zimri hath conspired , and hath also slain the king : wherefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
and it came to pass , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he wrought , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin , to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he shewed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal , which he had built in Samaria .
and Ahab made a grove ; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him .
and it shall be , that thou shalt drink of the Brook ; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there .
so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord : for he went and dwelt by the Brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the Brook .
and it came to pass after a while , that the Brook dried up , because there had been no rain in the land .
and as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand .
and Elijah said unto her , Fear not ; go and do as thou hast said : but make me thereof a little cake first , and bring it unto me , and after make for thee and for THY son .
for thus saith the Lord God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth .
and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
and the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by Elijah .
and he stretched himself upon the child three times , and cried unto the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , I pray thee , let this child 's soul come into him again .
and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
and Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and Elijah said , See , THY son liveth .
and it came to pass after many days , that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year , saying , Go , shew thyself unto Ahab ; and I will send rain upon the earth .
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord , that Obadiah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
and as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Art thou that my lord Elijah ?
and it came to pass , when midday was past , and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , unto whom the word of the Lord came , saying , Israel shall be THY name :
and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord : and he made a trench about the altar , as great as would contain two measures of seed .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bullock in pieces , and laid him on the wood , and said , fill four barrels with water , and pour it on the burnt sacrifice , and on the wood .
then the fire of the Lord fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
and when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , The Lord , he is the God ; the Lord , he is the God .
and Elijah said unto them , Take the prophets of Baal ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon , and slew them there .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . and Ahab rode , and went to Jezreel .
and when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beer @-@ sheba , which belongeth to Judah , and left his servant there .
and he looked , and , behold , there was a cake baken on the coals , and a cruse of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and he arose , and did eat and drink , and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God .
and it shall come to pass , that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay : and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay .
yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal , and every mouth which hath not kissed him .
then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty two : and after them he numbered all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
and they went out at noon . but Ben @-@ hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty and two kings that helped him .
and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Ben @-@ hadad sent out , and they told him , saying , There are men come out of Samaria .
so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city , and the army which followed them .
and do this thing , Take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put captains in their rooms :
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @-@ hadad numbered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
and they pitched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day .
and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the Lord , Smite me , I pray thee . and the man refused to smite him .
and as THY servant was busy here and there , he was gone . and the king of Israel said unto him , So shall THY judgment be ; thyself hast decided it .
and set two men , sons of Belial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , Thou didst blaspheme God and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , which is in Samaria : behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , whither he is gone down to possess it .
and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat .
and he did very abominably in following idols , according to all things as did the Amorites , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard those words , that he rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
and it came to pass in the third year , that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel .
and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , inquire , I pray thee , at the word of the Lord to day .
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and he said , Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne , and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , surely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , Every man to his city , and every man to his own country .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake .
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he shewed , and how he warred , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
behold , there came fire down from heaven , and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties : therefore let my life now be precious in THY sight .
so he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken . and Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
and Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smote the waters , and they were divided hither and thither , so that they two went over on dry ground .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of Jordan ;
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and Elisha said , As the Lord of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
and ye shall smite every fenced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on armour , and upward , and stood in the border .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites , so that they fled before them : but they went forward smiting the Moabites , even in their country .
and when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of Edom : but they could not .
and when thou art come in , thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon THY sons , and shalt pour out into all those vessels , and thou shalt set aside that which is full .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
and when the child was grown , it fell on a day , that he went out to his father to the reapers .
and she went up , and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the door upon him , and went out .
then she saddled an ass , and said to her servant , Drive , and go forward ; Slack not THY riding for me , except I bid thee .
and when Elisha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage : for they knew them not .
and the Syrians had gone out by companies , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid ; and she waited on Naaman 's wife .
and one went in , and told his lord , saying , Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come unto thee , behold , I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy .
are not Abana and Pharpar , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? May I not wash in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
and when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
and the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
and in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab : for the daughter of Ahab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
so Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him : and he rose by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him about , and the captains of the chariots : and the people fled into their tents .
and the rest of the acts of Joram , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did evil in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of Ahab : for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab .
and Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , Gird up THY loins , and take this box of oil in thine hand , and go to Ramoth @-@ gilead :
and when thou comest thither , look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber ;
and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab THY master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of Jezebel .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish : and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel :
and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah :
and Jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
and when Jehu was come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
and he said , throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
and they went to bury her : but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
and Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . and Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , unto the rulers of Jezreel , to the elders , and to them that brought up Ahab 's children , saying ,
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Jezreel .
know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord , which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab : for the Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah .
so Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , and all his great men , and his kinsfolks , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
and when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he spake to Elijah .
Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king .
and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David 's spears and shields , that were in the temple of the Lord .
and when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the temple of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king 's house : and there was she slain .
and all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was in quiet : and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king 's house .
let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found .
but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
and to masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the Lord bowls of silver , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @-@ hadad the son of Hazael , all their days .
( and the Lord gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who made Israel sin , but walked therein : and there remained the grove also in Samaria . )
neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and Joash slept with his fathers ; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne : and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
and he said to the king of Israel , Put thine hand upon the bow . and he put his hand upon it : and Elisha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and Elisha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , yet not like David his father : he did according to all things as Joash his father did .
and it came to pass , as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand , that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father .
but Amaziah would not hear . therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth @-@ shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and Judah was put to the worse before Israel ; and they fled every man to their tents .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
and the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem : and he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and slew him there .
and all the people of Judah took Azariah , which was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father Amaziah .
in the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria , and reigned forty and one years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
for the Lord saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any helper for Israel .
and the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven : but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah had done ;
and the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
so Azariah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Zachariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of the Lord which he spake unto Jehu , saying , Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
for Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
and Pul the king of Assyria came against the land : and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
and the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and smote him , and slew him , and reigned in his stead , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
and the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord : he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yea , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drave the Jews from Elath : and the Syrians came to Elath , and dwelt there unto this day .
and the king of Assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to Kir , and slew Rezin .
and Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus : so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus .
and when the king was come from Damascus , the king saw the altar : and the king approached to the altar , and offered thereon .
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
and he brought also the brasen altar , which was before the Lord , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the laver from off them ; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it , and put it upon a pavement of stones .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away into Assyria , and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
and walked in the statutes of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger :
notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the Lord their God .
and they left all the commandments of the Lord their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made a grove , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served Baal .
therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
and the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord , and made them sin a great sin .
for the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they departed not from them ;
until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight , as he had said by all his servants the prophets . so was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day .
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear the Lord .
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt .
and the men of Babylon made Succoth @-@ benoth , and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
so they feared the Lord , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
with whom the Lord had made a Covenant , and charged them saying , Ye shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them :
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and the Covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget ; neither shall ye fear other gods .
now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father did .
he trusted in the Lord God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor any that were before him .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
and the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes :
because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God , but transgressed his Covenant , and all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded , and would not hear them , nor do them .
and Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
Thou sayest , ( but they are but vain words , ) I have counsel and strength for the war . now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
now therefore , I pray thee , give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria , and I will deliver thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rab @-@ shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria :
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand ?
and it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
and when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , behold , he is come out to fight against thee : he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not THY God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed ; as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar ?
and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
Lord , bow down thine ear , and hear : open , Lord , thine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent him to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , I beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God , even thou only .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the Lord .
and it came to pass , afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
and Hezekiah answered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees .
and Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord : and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward , by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz .
at that time Berodach @-@ baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah : for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hephzi @-@ bah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , after the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
and I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day .
and Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
and he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served , and worshipped them :
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand , because they dealt faithfully .
and Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clothes .
and the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asahiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
but to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , As touching the words which thou hast heard ;
nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem , but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren .
and he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
and he brake in pieces the images , and cut down the groves , and filled their places with the bones of men .
notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
and Pharaoh @-@ nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
and Pharaoh @-@ nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father , and turned his name to Jehoiakim , and took Jehoahaz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zebudah , the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiachin was Eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem three months . and his mother 's name was Nehushta , the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .

and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city , and his servants did besiege it .
and the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father 's brother king in his stead , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho : and all his army were scattered from him .
so they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment upon him .
and they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
and he burnt the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jerusalem , and every great man 's house burnt he with fire .
and all the army of the Chaldees , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and the pots , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and the firepans , and the bowls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
the two pillars , one sea , and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord ; the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
and Nebuzar @-@ adan captain of the guard took these , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah :
and the king of Babylon smote them , and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away out of their land .
and all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the armies , arose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chaldees .

for these Levites , the four chief porters , were in their set office , and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God .
some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanctuary , and the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices .
and Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the set office over the things that were made in the pans .
and other of their brethren , of the sons of the Kohathites , were over the shewbread , to prepare it every sabbath .
and these are the singers , chief of the fathers of the Levites , who remaining in the chambers were free : for they were employed in that work day and night .
and the Philistines followed hard after Saul , and after his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi @-@ shua , the sons of Saul .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and when they had stripped him , they took his head , and his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to carry tidings unto their idols , and to the people .
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel , and delivered it , and slew the Philistines ; and the Lord saved them by a great deliverance .
now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
and Abishai the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spear against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honourable than the two ; for he was their captain : howbeit he attained not to the first three .
Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah , that pertained to the children of Benjamin , Benaiah the Pirathonite ,
they were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow , even of Saul 's brethren of Benjamin .
the chief was Ahiezer , then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite ; and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth ; and Berachah , and Jehu the Antothite ,
and Ismaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty ; and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Josabad the Gederathite ,
these were of the sons of Gad , captains of the host : one of the least was over an hundred , and the greatest over a thousand .
these are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had overflown all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zilthai , captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh .
and they helped David against the band of the rovers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captains in the host .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valour for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valour , and of his father 's house twenty and two captains .
and of the children of Benjamin , the kindred of Saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul .
and of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred , mighty men of valour , famous throughout the house of their fathers .
and all the Congregation said that they would do so : for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
and they carried the Ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza , and he smote him , because he put his hand to the Ark : and there he died before God .
so David brought not the Ark home to himself to the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite .
and David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel , for his kingdom was lifted up on high , because of his people Israel .
and when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David . and David heard of it , and went out against them .
therefore David inquired again of God ; and God said unto him , Go not up after them ; turn away from them , and come upon them over against the mulberry trees .
and David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Lord unto his place , which he had prepared for it .
of the sons of Kohath ; Uriel the chief , and his brethren an hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Merari ; Asaiah the chief , and his brethren two hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Gershom ; Joel the chief , and his brethren an hundred and thirty :
of the sons of Uzziel ; Amminadab the chief , and his brethren an hundred and twelve .
for because ye did it not at the first , the Lord our God made a breach upon us , for that we sought him not after the due order .
and the children of the Levites bare the Ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord .
and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brethren , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brethren , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass ;
and it came to pass , when God helped the Levites that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams .
so they brought the Ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God .
and when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord .
and he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
and say ye , Save us , O God of our salvation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the heathen , that we may give thanks to THY holy name , and glory in THY praise .
so he left there before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required :
to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he commanded Israel ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the Lord , because his mercy endureth for ever ;
and it came to pass the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying ,
for I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day ; but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tabernacle to another .
now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , even from following the sheep , that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel :
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son : and I will not take my mercy away from him , as I took it from him that was before thee :
O Lord , for THY servant 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of THY servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou blessest , O Lord , and it shall be blessed for ever .
and when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah , David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
and David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
likewise from Tibhath , and from Chun , cities of Hadarezer , brought David very much brass , wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
now it came to pass after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his stead .
and the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and it came to pass after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines ; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were subdued .
then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
and as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
and David built there an altar unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the Lord ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
and David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God .
and David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the joinings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
and David said to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God :
then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismayed .
moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance , hewers and workers of stone and timber , and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work .
of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . arise therefore , and be doing , and the Lord be with thee .
now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
of which , twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the Lord ; and six thousand were officers and judges :
and Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their father 's house .
and David distributed them , both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , according to their offices in their service .
of the Izharites ; Shelomoth : of the sons of Shelomoth ; Jahath .
the sons also of Mushi ; Mahli , and Eder , and Jerimoth . these were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers .
of the sons of Asaph ; Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asarelah , the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph , which prophesied according to the order of the king .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord , even all that were cunning , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
concerning the divisions of the porters : of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of kore , of the sons of Asaph .
also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of valour .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ; )
among these were the divisions of the porters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the Lord .
and they cast lots , as well the small as the great , according to the house of their fathers , for every gate .
and of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Jehieli ; Zetham , and Joel his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the Lord .
which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated .
the third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , a chief priest : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
furthermore over the tribes of Israel : the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri : of the Simeonites , Shephatiah the son of Maachah :
of the children of Ephraim , Hoshea the son of Azaziah : of the half tribe of Manasseh , Joel the son of Pedaiah :
but David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under : because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David .
and over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the storehouses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah :
and over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub :
and over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baal @-@ hanan the Gederite : and over the cellars of oil was Joash :
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai :
also Jonathan David 's uncle was a counseller , a wise man , and a scribe : and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king 's sons :
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims , that spread out their wings , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , to overlay the walls of the houses withal :
then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers of the king 's work , offered willingly ,
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass Eighteen thousand talents , and one hundred thousand talents of iron .
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the Lord , by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , for that they offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of thine own have we given thee .
for we are strangers before thee , and sojourners , as were all our fathers : our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is none abiding .
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep THY commandments , THY testimonies , and THY statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
and the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
and Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom , and the Lord his God was with him , and magnified him exceedingly .
then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the Congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the Congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
but the Ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath @-@ jearim to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the brasen altar , that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Congregation sought unto it .
and Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the Lord , which was at the tabernacle of the Congregation , and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it .
now , O Lord God , let THY promise unto David my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the Congregation , and reigned over Israel .
and the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance .
and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa ; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem .
and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah , where the Lord appeared unto David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the posts , and the walls thereof , and the doors thereof , with gold ; and graved cherubims on the walls .
and he made the most holy house , the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits : and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was five cubits also , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high , and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
and he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
moreover he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits the length thereof , and twenty cubits the breadth thereof , and ten cubits the height thereof .
also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred basons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid the doors of them with brass .
and Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basons . and Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ;
and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths ; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath , to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars .
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , these did the priests and the Levites bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the Ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
there was nothing in the Ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb , when the Lord made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place : ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course :
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God .
and the king turned his face , and blessed the whole Congregation of Israel : and all the Congregation of Israel stood .
and he said , blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David , saying ,
but the Lord said to David my father , Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name , thou didst well in that it was in thine heart :
notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house ; but THY son which shall come forth out of THY loins , he shall build the house for my name .
and in it have I put the Ark , wherein is the Covenant of the Lord , that he made with the children of Israel .
and he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the Congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands :
Thou which hast kept with THY servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
and if THY people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee ; and shall return and confess THY name , and pray and make supplication before thee in this house ;
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man , or of all THY people Israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear thou from heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
that they may fear thee , to walk in THY ways , so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
if THY people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for THY name ;
now , my God , let , I beseech thee , thine eyes be open , and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
now therefore arise , O Lord God , into THY resting place , thou , and the Ark of THY strength : let THY priests , O Lord God , be clothed with salvation , and let THY saints rejoice in Goodness .
and the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord 's house .
and king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great Congregation , from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt .
and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard THY prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David THY father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
but if ye turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
that the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built Beth @-@ horon the upper , and Beth @-@ horon the nether , fenced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen .
and these were the chief of king Solomon 's officers , even two hundred and fifty , that bare rule over the people .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord , and until it was finished . so the house of the Lord was perfected .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of THY wisdom :
and the servants also of Huram , and the servants of Solomon , which brought gold from Ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold ;
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps . there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harness , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , ease somewhat the yoke that THY father did put upon us ?
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the Lord :
and after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers .
and it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the Lord ,
he reigned three years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . and there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
and there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
and when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the Lord , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass , that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
and Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter : so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers .
and Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him , Bethel with the towns thereof , and Jeshnah with the towns thereof , and Ephrain with the towns thereof .
so Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and ASA his son reigned in his stead . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
and there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariots ; and came unto Mareshah .
and they smote all the cities round about Gerar ; for the fear of the Lord came upon them : and they spoiled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
but when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of ASA .
that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and it came to pass , when Baasha heard it , that he left off building of Ramah , and let his work cease .
then ASA the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha was building ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
then ASA was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and ASA oppressed some of the people the same time .
and , behold , the acts of ASA , first and last , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which ASA his father had taken .
and the Lord was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and sought not unto Baalim ;
but sought to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord : moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah .
and they taught in Judah , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught the people .
and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
and he had much business in the cities of Judah : and the men of war , mighty men of valour , were in Jerusalem .
and next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself unto the Lord ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour .
and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , inquire , I pray thee , at the word of the Lord to day .
and the Lord said , Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ gilead ? and one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
for it came to pass , that , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
and Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem : and he went out again through the people from Beer @-@ sheba to mount Ephraim , and brought them back unto the Lord God of their fathers .
then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the Congregation ;
to morrow go ye down against them : behold , they come up by the cliff of Ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Brook , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord , worshipping the Lord .
and the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites , and of the children of the Korhites , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high .
and when they began to sing and to praise , the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , which were come against Judah ; and they were smitten .
and when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel .
and Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
and he walked in the way of ASA his father , and departed not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord .
Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish : and they made the ships in Ezion @-@ geber .
now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
and he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat , Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father , he strengthened himself , and slew all his brethren with the sword , and divers also of the princes of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord .
then Jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him in , and the captains of the chariots .
so the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . the same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand ; because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers .
moreover the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines , and of the Arabians , that were near the Ethiopians :
and the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram : for when he was come , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi , whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab .
and it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them .
but when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah .
and they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
and all the Congregation made a Covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , behold , the king 's son shall reign , as the Lord hath said of the sons of David .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the doors ;
moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew her there .
and Jehoiada made a Covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the Lord 's people .
then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
and all the people of the land rejoiced : and the city was quiet , after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Zibiah of Beer @-@ sheba .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Baalim .
and at the king 's commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the Lord .
and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness .
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
but Jehoiada waxed old , and was full of days when he died ; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died .
and they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his house .
now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . then the king hearkened unto them .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the Lord ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . and when he died , he said , The Lord look upon it , and require it .
Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the Lord is not with Israel , to wit , with all the children of Ephraim .
but if thou wilt go , do it , be strong for the battle : God shall make thee fall before the enemy : for God hath power to help , and to cast down .
then Amaziah separated them , to wit , the army that was come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in great anger .
and Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the chidren of Seir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
so Joash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Beth @-@ shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and Judah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
then all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah did .
and he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosper .
and the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself exceedingly .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he transgressed against the Lord his God , and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jerushah , the daughter of Zadok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Uzziah did : howbeit he entered not into the temple of the Lord . and the people did yet corruptly .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah that was next to the king .
and the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the Lord your God ?
now hear me therefore , and deliver the captives again , which ye have taken captive of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the king of Assyria : but he helped him not .
and in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods , and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers .
now the rest of his acts and of all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
and Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the Lord , and repaired them .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel .
and they gathered their brethren , and sanctified themselves , and came , according to the commandment of the king , by the words of the Lord , to cleanse the house of the Lord .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and , behold , they are before the altar of the Lord .
and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
and when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves , and worshipped .
and also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and the drink offerings for every burnt offering . so the service of the house of the Lord was set in order .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the Congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
and they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the Congregation that were not sanctified : therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean , to sanctify them unto the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the Lord .
for Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the Congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the Congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
and all the Congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the Congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ,
be strong and courageous , be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude that is with him : for there be more with us than with him :
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the Lord our God to help us , and to fight our battles . and the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst , saying , The Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and they spake against the God of Jerusalem , as against the gods of the people of the earth , which were the work of the hands of man .
thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all other , and guided them on every side .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
and Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour : and he made himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant jewels ;
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David . and Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
but did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , like unto the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down , and he reared up altars for Baalim , and made groves , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria , which took Manasseh among the thorns , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
and prayed unto him : and he was intreated of him , and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ;
but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and so did he in the cities of Manasseh , and Ephraim , and Simeon , even unto Naphtali , with their mattocks round about .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses .
and Shaphan carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to THY servants , they do it .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he rent his clothes .
and the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah :
and as for the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , so shall ye say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard ;
and he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it . and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the Covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
and he set the priests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of the Lord ,
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Levites .
so kill the passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites in their courses , according to the king 's commandment .
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
so all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day , to keep the passover , and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
and Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day , and made them an ordinance in Israel : and , behold , they are written in the lamentations .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his Goodness , according to that which was written in the law of the Lord ,
and his deeds , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and made him king in his father 's stead in Jerusalem .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord .
and when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God , and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord .
and he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel .
moreover all the chief of the priests , and the people , transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen ; and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem .
and the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up betimes , and sending ; because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
but they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his words , and misused his prophets , until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people , till there was no remedy .
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes ; all these he brought to Babylon .
and they burnt the house of God , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof .
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
thus saith Cyrus king of Persia , The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .
the children of Pahath @-@ moab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand eight hundred and twelve .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy and three .
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Peruda ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Ami .
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty and two .
and of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai ; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name :
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
they kept also the feast of tabernacles , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number , according to the custom , as the duty of every day required ;
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord . but the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid .
and hired counsellers against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
and in the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto Artaxerxes the king ; Thy servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king 's dishonour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ;
there have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , which have ruled over all countries beyond the river ; and toll , tribute , and custom , was paid unto them .
now when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of God helping them .
then said we unto them after this manner , What are the names of the men that make this building ?
but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
we asked their names also , to certify thee , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
and said unto him , Take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be builded in his place .
then came the same Sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now hath it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rolls , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
and there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the Medes , a roll , and therein was a record thus written :
let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
then Tatnai , governor on this side the river , Shethar @-@ boznai , and their companions , according to that which Darius the king had sent , so they did speedily .
and this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
and they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
for the priests and the Levites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , unto Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord , and of his statutes to Israel .
Artaxerxes , king of kings , unto Ezra the priest , a scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king , and of his seven counsellers , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of THY God which is in thine hand ;
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee , and to THY brethren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of THY God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of THY God , which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven : for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
these are now the chief of their fathers , and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king .
of the sons of Phinehas ; Gershom : of the sons of Ithamar ; Daniel : of the sons of David ; Hattush .
of the sons of Shechaniah , of the sons of Pharosh ; Zechariah : and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty .
of the sons of Shechaniah ; the son of Jahaziel , and with him three hundred males .
and of the sons of Shelomith ; the son of Josiphiah , and with him an hundred and threescore males .
and of the sons of Bebai ; Zechariah the son of Bebai , and with him twenty and eight males .
and of the sons of Azgad ; Johanan the son of Hakkatan , and with him an hundred and ten males .
also of the Nethinims , whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinims : all of them were expressed by name .
I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels an hundred talents , and of gold an hundred talents ;
so took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God .
and said , O my God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my God : for our iniquities are increased over our head , and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens .
and they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ;
now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass .
also of the Levites ; Jozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah , ( the same is Kelita , ) Pethahiah , Judah , and Eliezer .
moreover of Israel : of the sons of Parosh ; Ramiah , and Jeziah , and Malchiah , and Miamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah . and it came to pass in the month Chisleu , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and they said unto me , The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach : the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned with fire .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days , and fasted , and prayed before the God of heaven ,
and said , I beseech thee , O Lord God of heaven , the great and terrible God , that keepeth Covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou commandedst THY servant Moses .
then I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass .
and next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz . and next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel . and next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana .
moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah , and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite , and Jadon the Meronothite , the men of Gibeon , and of Mizpah , unto the throne of the governor on this side the river .
next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , of the goldsmiths . next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries , and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall .
and next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , he and his daughters .
the valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the Dung gate .
and next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall .
Palal the son of Uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
but it came to pass , that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall , he was wroth , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
and cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee : for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders .
and it came to pass , that when the Jews which dwelt by them came , they said unto us ten times , From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you .
therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
they which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
so we laboured in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared .
I likewise , and my brethren , and my servants , might exact of them money and corn : I pray you , let us leave off this usury .
Yea , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me , saying , Come , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono . but they thought to do me mischief .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul , in fifty and two days .
moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came unto them .
for there were many in Judah sworn unto him , because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah .
now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
the children of Pahath @-@ moab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand and eight hundred and Eighteen .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy and three .
the Levites : the children of Jeshua , of Kadmiel , and of the children of Hodevah , seventy and four .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Perida ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Amon .
and these were they which went up also from Telmelah , Telharesha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer : but they could not shew their father 's house , nor their seed , whether they were of Israel .
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred forty and two .
and of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but it was not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver .
and Ezra the priest brought the law before the Congregation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly , and gave the sense , and caused them to understand the reading .
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , unto Ezra the scribe , even to understand the words of the law .
and they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month :
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they confessed , and worshipped the Lord their God .
and thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
Yea , forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness , so that they lacked nothing ; their clothes waxed not old , and their feet swelled not .
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven , and broughtest them into the land , concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast THY law behind their backs , and slew THY prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept THY law , nor hearkened unto THY commandments and THY testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
for they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in THY great Goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
now those that sealed were , Nehemiah , the Tirshatha , the son of Hachaliah , and Zidkijah ,
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground , and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees , year by year , unto the house of the Lord :
and the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts to dwell in other cities .
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Col @-@ hozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of Shiloni .
all the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jesaiah .
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , was the ruler of the house of God .
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
and Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chief of the Levites , had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God .
for it was the king 's commandment concerning them , that a certain portion should be for the singers , due for every day .
and Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel , of the children of Zerah the son of Judah , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
the sons of Levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
these were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest , the scribe .
then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the Dung gate :
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets ; namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph :
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God , and I , and the half of the rulers with me :
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the Congregation of God for ever ;
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them : howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing .
now it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
and before this , Eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tobiah :
but in all this time was not I at Jerusalem : for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king , and after certain days obtained I leave of the king :
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
and I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
there dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish , and all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
and one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
thus cleansed I them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites , every one in his business ;
now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus , ( this is Ahasuerus which reigned , from India even unto Ethiopia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
then the king said to the wise men , which knew the times , ( for so was the king 's manner toward all that knew law and judgment :
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
after these things , when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ;
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
then thus came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house .
so Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
in those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and the thing was known to Mordecai , who told it unto Esther the queen ; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai 's name .
and when Inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
and when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence , then was Haman full of wrath .
and he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even the people of Mordecai .
and the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
the posts went out , being hastened by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given in Shushan the palace . and the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city Shushan was perplexed .
when Mordecai perceived all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
and in every province , whithersoever the king 's commandment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fasting , and weeping , and wailing ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
so Esther 's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king 's chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
and the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine , What is THY petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is THY request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
then Esther the queen answered and said , If I have found favour in THY sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
on that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews ' enemy unto Esther the queen . and Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was unto her .
and Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
and he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries :
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out , being hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . and the decree was given at Shushan the palace .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people .
for Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces : for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater .
thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
and Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha ,
on that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king .
then said Esther , If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day 's decree , and let Haman 's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows .
for the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
but the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof ; and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
to stablish this among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
but when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
and he sent the letters unto all the Jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one that feared God , and eschewed evil .
and his sons went and feasted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house :
and the Sabeans fell upon them , and took them away ; yea , they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Thy sons and THY daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house :
again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord .
and the Lord said unto Satan , From whence comest thou ? and Satan answered the Lord , and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spake a word unto him : for they saw that his grief was very great .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day :
for now should I have lain still and been quiet , I should have slept : then had I been at rest ,
for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me .
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
it stood still , but I could not discern the form thereof : an image was before mine eyes , there was silence , and I heard a voice , saying ,
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
to set up on high those that be low ; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety .
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
and thou shalt know that THY tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit THY habitation , and shalt not sin .
Thou shalt know also that THY seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
Thou shalt come to THY grave in a full age , like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season .
for the arrows of the Almighty are within me , the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit : the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me .
what is my strength , that I should hope ? and what is mine end , that I should prolong my life ?
when I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day .
therefore I will not refrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
I have sinned ; what shall I do unto thee , O thou preserver of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame ; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought .
if I speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to plead ?
if I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ?
my soul is weary of my life ; I will leave my complaint upon myself ; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
if I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
I should have been as though I had not been ; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom , that they are double to that which is ! know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth .
if iniquity be in thine hand , put it far away , and let not wickedness dwell in THY tabernacles .
for then shalt thou lift up THY face without spot ; yea , thou shalt be stedfast , and shalt not fear :
and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday ; thou shalt shine forth , thou shalt be as the morning .
and thou shalt be secure , because there is hope ; yea , thou shalt dig about thee , and thou shalt take THY rest in safety .
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea , many shall make suit unto thee .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you : yea , who knoweth not such things as these ?
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
behold , he withholdeth the waters , and they dry up : also he sendeth them out , and they overturn the earth .
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
who is he that will plead with me ? for now , if I hold my tongue , I shall give up the ghost .
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
for there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
so man lieth down , and riseth not : till the heavens be no more , they shall not awake , nor be raised out of their sleep .
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest keep me secret , until THY wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
the waters wear the stones : thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth ; and thou destroyest the hope of man .
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he is waited for of the sword .
and he dwelleth in desolate cities , and in houses which no man inhabiteth , which are ready to become heaps .
he shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his branches , and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away .
I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul 's stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
he teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me : he gnasheth upon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me .
they have gaped upon me with their mouth ; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully ; they have gathered themselves together against me .
I was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder : he hath also taken me by my neck , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
his archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
I have said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worm , Thou are my mother , and my sister .
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle , and it shall bring him to the king of terrors .
it shall dwell in his tabernacle , because it is none of his : brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation .
they that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a stranger : I am an alien in their sight .
my breath is strange to my wife , though I intreated for the children 's sake of mine own body .
whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another ; though my reins be consumed within me .
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found : yea , he shall be chased away as a vision of the night .
his bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
he hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again : God shall cast them out of his belly .
that which he laboured for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down : according to his substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor ; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not ;
when he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
it is drawn , and cometh out of the body ; yea , the glittering sword cometh out of his gall : terrors are upon him .
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
the increase of his house shall depart , and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath .
as for me , is my complaint to man ? and if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
receive , I pray thee , the law from his mouth , and lay up his words in thine heart .
Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon THY ways .
when men are cast down , then thou shalt say , There is lifting up ; and he shall save the humble person .
I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would say unto me .
on the left hand , where he doth work , but I cannot behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I cannot see him :
neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips ; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath he covered the darkness from my face .
behold , as wild asses in the desert , go they forth to their work ; rising betimes for a prey : the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
the womb shall forget him ; the worm shall feed sweetly on him ; he shall be no more remembered ; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree .
behold even to the moon , and it shineth not ; yea , the stars are not pure in his sight .
my righteousness I hold fast , and will not let it go : my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
the east wind carrieth him away , and he departeth : and as a storm hurleth him out of his place .
for God shall cast upon him , and not spare : he would fain flee out of his hand .
the gold and the crystal cannot equal it : and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold .
when I went out to the gate through the city , when I prepared my seat in the street !
when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me :
because I delivered the poor that cried , and the fatherless , and him that had none to help him .
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me : and I caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
I was a father to the poor : and the cause which I knew not I searched out .
and they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
by the great force of my disease is my garment changed : it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat .
if my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands ;
then let me sow , and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be rooted out .
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother 's womb ; )
if his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the Fleece of my sheep ;
then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone .
then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram : against Job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than God .
and Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said , I am young , and ye are very old ; wherefore I was afraid , and durst not shew you mine opinion .
behold , I waited for your words ; I gave ear to your reasons , whilst ye searched out what to say .
I will speak , that I may be refreshed : I will open my lips and answer .
let me not , I pray you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the voice of THY words , saying ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ;
he shall pray unto God , and he will be favourable unto him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will render unto man his righteousness .
Lo , all these things worketh God oftentimes with man ,
for the work of a man shall he render unto him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich more than the poor ? for they all are the work of his hands .
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
for thou saidst , What advantage will it be unto thee ? and , What profit shall I have , if I be cleansed from my sin ?
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry : they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty .
but now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity :
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
but if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on THY table should be full of fatness .
with clouds he covereth the light ; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt .
after it a voice roareth : he thundereth with the voice of his excellency ; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard .
for he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
and it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds : but the wind passeth , and cleanseth them .
touching the Almighty , we cannot find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not afflict .
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth , that the wicked might be shaken out of it ?
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof ?
who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters , or a way for the lightning of Thunder ;
to cause it to rain on the earth , where no man is ; on the wilderness , wherein there is no man ;
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who hath given understanding to the heart ?
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
cast abroad the rage of THY wrath : and behold every one that is proud , and abase him .
look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tread down the wicked in their place .
behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
so the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses .
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
the kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the Lord , and against his anointed , saying ,
Kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
I cried unto the Lord with my voice , and he heard me out of his holy hill . Selah .
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that have set themselves against me round about .
arise , O Lord ; save me , O my God : for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone ; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly .
hear me when I call , O God of my righteousness : thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress ; have mercy upon me , and hear my prayer .
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
but as for me , I will come into THY house in the multitude of THY mercy : and in THY fear will I worship toward THY holy temple .
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth ; their inward part is very wickedness ; their throat is an open sepulchre ; they flatter with their tongue .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love THY name be joyful in thee .
O Lord my God , in thee do I put my trust : save me from all them that persecute me , and deliver me :
if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
let the enemy persecute my soul , and take it ; yea , let him tread down my life upon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust . Selah .
arise , O Lord , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
the Lord shall judge the people : judge me , O Lord , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors .
when I consider THY heavens , the work of THY fingers , the moon and the stars , which thou hast ordained ;
the fowl of the air , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas .
Thou hast rebuked the heathen , thou hast destroyed the wicked , thou hast put out their name for ever and ever .
and they that know THY name will put their trust in thee : for thou , Lord , hast not forsaken them that seek thee .
the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken .
the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor : let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined .
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages : in the secret places doth he murder the innocent : his eyes are privily set against the poor .
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
Thou hast seen it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with THY hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless .
Lord , thou hast heard the desire of the humble : thou wilt prepare their heart , thou wilt cause thine ear to hear :
for , lo , the wicked bend their bow , they make ready their arrow upon the string , that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart .
the Lord is in his holy temple , the Lord 's throne is in heaven : his eyes behold , his eyelids try , the children of men .
upon the wicked he shall rain snares , fire and brimstone , and an horrible tempest : this shall be the portion of their cup .
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour : with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak .
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread , and call not upon the Lord .
he that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doeth evil to his neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour .
he that putteth not out his money to usury , nor taketh reward against the innocent . he that doeth these things shall never be moved .
but to the saints that are in the earth , and to the excellent , in whom is all my delight .
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god : their drink offerings of blood will I not offer , nor take up their names into my lips .
I have set the Lord always before me : because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
concerning the works of men , by the word of THY lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer .
Shew THY marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by THY right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
as for me , I will behold THY face in righteousness : I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with THY likeness .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the Horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
I will call upon the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
in my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried unto my God : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears .
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
and he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : yea , he did fly upon the wings of the wind .
he made darkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at THY rebuke , O Lord , at the blast of the breath of THY nostrils .
for by thee I have run through a troop ; and by my God have I leaped over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect : the word of the Lord is tried : he is a buckler to all those that trust in him .
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me , they shall obey me : the strangers shall submit themselves unto me .
he delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
his going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof .
keep back THY servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not have dominion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be innocent from the great transgression .
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger : the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath , and the fire shall devour them .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon THY strings against the face of them .
but thou art he that took me out of the womb : thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother 's breasts .
I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint : my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels .
my strength is dried up like a potsherd ; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws ; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death .
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted ; neither hath he hid his face from him ; but when he cried unto him , he heard .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; THY rod and THY staff they comfort me .
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
surely Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever .
lift up your head , O ye gates ; and be ye lift up , ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in .
what man is he that feareth the Lord ? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose .
judge me , O Lord ; for I have walked in mine integrity : I have trusted also in the Lord ; therefore I shall not slide .
the Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as breathe out cruelty .
I had fainted , unless I had believed to see the Goodness of the Lord in the land of the living .
unto thee will I cry , O Lord my rock ; be not silent to me : lest , if thou be silent to me , I become like them that go down into the pit .
the Lord is my strength and my shield ; my heart trusted in him , and I am helped : therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth ; and with my song will I praise him .
I will extol thee , O Lord ; for thou hast lifted me up , and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me .
O Lord , thou hast brought up my soul from the grave : thou hast kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit .
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing : thou hast put off my sackcloth , and girded me with gladness ;
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent . O Lord my God , I will give thanks unto thee for ever .
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : thou hast set my feet in a large room .
have mercy upon me , O Lord , for I am in trouble : mine eye is consumed with grief , yea , my soul and my belly .
for my life is spent with grief , and my years with sighing : my strength faileth because of mine iniquity , and my bones are consumed .
I was a reproach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
for I have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
my times are in THY hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enemies , and from them that persecute me .
let me not be ashamed , O Lord ; for I have called upon thee : let the wicked be ashamed , and let them be silent in the grave .
Oh how great is THY Goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of THY presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
be ye not as the horse , or as the mule , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle , lest they come near unto thee .
by the word of the Lord were the heavens made ; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth .
the Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought : he maketh the devices of the people of none effect .
behold , the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him , upon them that hope in his mercy ;
the face of the Lord is against them that do evil , to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth .
the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart ; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit .
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they have digged for my soul .
let destruction come upon him at unawares ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
all my bones shall say , Lord , who is like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him , yea , the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him ?
let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me : neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause .
let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt : let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me .
he deviseth mischief upon his bed ; he setteth himself in a way that is not good ; he abhorreth not evil .
how excellent is THY lovingkindness , O God ! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of THY wings .
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of THY house ; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of THY pleasures .
let not the foot of pride come against me , and let not the hand of the wicked remove me .
there are the workers of iniquity fallen : they are cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for him : fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way , because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time : and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
but the wicked shall perish , and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be Cursed of him shall be cut off .
though he fall , he shall not be utterly cast down : for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand .
yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : yea , I sought him , but he could not be found .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin .
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease : and there is no soundness in my flesh .
my heart panteth , my strength faileth me : as for the light of mine eyes , it also is gone from me .
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me : and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and imagine deceits all the day long .
for I said , Hear me , lest otherwise they should rejoice over me : when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against me .
I said , I will take heed to my ways , that I sin not with my tongue : I will keep my mouth with a bridle , while the wicked is before me .
hear my prayer , O Lord , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not THY peace at my tears : for I am a stranger with thee , and a sojourner , as all my fathers were .
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings .
and he hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our God : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the Lord .
blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust , and respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
I have not hid THY righteousness within my heart ; I have declared THY faithfulness and THY salvation : I have not concealed THY lovingkindness and THY truth from the great Congregation .
for innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it ; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be blessed upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies .
Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me .
yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
for thou art the God of my strength : why dost thou cast me off ? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
we have heard with our ears , O God , our fathers have told us , what work thou didst in their days , in the times of old .
through thee will we push down our enemies : through THY name will we tread them under that rise up against us .
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us .
Yea , for THY sake are we killed all the day long ; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter .
my heart is inditing a good matter : I speak of the things which I have made touching the king : my tongue is the pen of a ready writer .
and the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift ; even the rich among the people shall intreat THY favour .
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea ;
there is a river , the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God , the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High .
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow , and cutteth the spear in sunder ; he burneth the chariot in the fire .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , is mount Zion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
I will incline mine ear to a parable : I will open my dark saying upon the harp .
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil , when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about ?
he shall call to the heavens from above , and to the earth , that he may judge his people .
if I were hungry , I would not tell thee : for the world is mine , and the fulness thereof .
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of THY dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . Selah .
but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God : I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever .
I will praise thee for ever , because thou hast done it : and I will wait on THY name ; for it is good before THY saints .
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , that did seek God .
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread : they have not called upon God .
because of the voice of the enemy , because of the oppression of the wicked : for they cast iniquity upon me , and in wrath they hate me .
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hath broken his Covenant .
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter , but war was in his heart : his words were softer than oil , yet were they drawn swords .
in God I will praise his word , in God I have put my trust ; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me .
for thou hast delivered my soul from death : wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living ?
be merciful unto me , O God , be merciful unto me : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of THY wings will I make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast .
he shall send from heaven , and save from the reproach of him that would swallow me up . Selah . God shall send forth his mercy and his truth .
my soul is among lions : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah .
let them melt away as waters which run continually : when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows , let them be as cut in pieces .
before your pots can feel the thorns , he shall take them away as with a whirlwind , both living , and in his wrath .
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride : and for cursing and lying which they speak .
and at evening let them return ; and let them make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
but I will sing of THY power ; yea , I will sing aloud of THY mercy in the morning : for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble .
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
Wilt not thou , O God , which hadst cast us off ? and thou , O God , which didst not go out with our armies ?
surely men of low degree are vanity , and men of high degree are a lie : to be laid in the balance , they are altogether lighter than vanity .
but those that seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth .
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness : and the little hills rejoice on every side .
Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads ; we went through fire and through water : but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
the earth shook , the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
Thou , O God , didst send a plentiful rain , whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance , when it was weary .
though ye have lien among the pots , yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver , and her feathers with yellow gold .
the chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .
Thou hast ascended on high , thou hast led captivity captive : thou hast received gifts for men ; yea , for the rebellious also , that the Lord God might dwell among them .
but God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses .
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enemies wrongfully , are mighty : then I restored that which I took not away .
let not them that wait on thee , O Lord God of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of THY mercy hear me , in the truth of THY salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and let me not sink : let me be delivered from them that hate me , and out of the deep waters .
let not the waterflood overflow me , neither let the deep swallow me up , and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me .
reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
they gave me also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink .
let their table become a snare before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap .
for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten ; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded .
for God will save Zion , and will build the cities of Judah : that they may dwell there , and have it in possession .
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
by thee have I been holden up from the womb : thou art he that took me out of my mother 's bowels : my praise shall be continually of thee .
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul ; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt .
now also when I am old and grayheaded , O God , forsake me not ; until I have shewed THY strength unto this generation , and THY power to every one that is to come .
my tongue also shall talk of THY righteousness all the day long : for they are confounded , for they are brought unto shame , that seek my hurt .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor .
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river unto the ends of the earth .
and he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba : prayer also shall be made for him continually ; and daily shall he be praised .
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
for , lo , they that are far from thee shall perish : thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee .
remember THY Congregation , which thou hast purchased of old ; the rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed ; this mount Zion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
they have cast fire into THY sanctuary , they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of THY name to the ground .
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces , and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness .
O deliver not the soul of THY turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked : forget not the Congregation of THY poor for ever .
unto thee , O God , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks : for that THY name is near THY wondrous works declare .
Thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in THY sight when once thou art angry ?
I cried unto God with my voice , even unto God with my voice ; and he gave ear unto me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord : my sore ran in the night , and ceased not : my soul refused to be comforted .
I call to remembrance my song in the night : I commune with mine own heart : and my spirit made diligent search .
we will not hide them from their children , shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord , and his strength , and his wonderful works that he hath done .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a law in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children :
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
he divided the sea , and caused them to pass through ; and he made the waters to stand as an heap .
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud , and all the night with a light of fire .
therefore the Lord heard this , and was wroth : so a fire was kindled against Jacob , and anger also came up against Israel ;
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
but he , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity , and destroyed them not : yea , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
he made a way to his anger ; he spared not their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ;
he cast out the heathen also before them , and divided them an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their Graven images .
the dead bodies of THY servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of THY saints unto the beasts of the earth .
we are become a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and derision to them that are round about us .
pour out THY wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee , and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon THY name .
help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of THY name : and deliver us , and purge away our sins , for THY name 's sake .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of THY power preserve thou those that are appointed to die ;
why hast thou then broken down her hedges , so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her ?
the Boar out of the wood doth waste it , and the wild beast of the field doth devour it .
this he ordained in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out through the land of Egypt : where I heard a language that I understood not .
I am the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt : open THY mouth wide , and I will fill it .
they know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
do unto them as unto the Midianites ; as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the Brook of Kison :
for a day in THY courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
among the gods there is none like unto thee , O Lord ; neither are there any works like unto THY works .
O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
I am counted with them that go down into the pit : I am as a man that hath no strength :
free among the dead , like the slain that lie in the grave , whom thou rememberest no more : and they are cut off from THY hand .
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : I am shut up , and I cannot come forth .
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever : with my mouth will I make known THY faithfulness to all generations .
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord ? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord ?
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints , and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him .
Thou hast made void the Covenant of THY servant : thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground .
what man is he that liveth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ? Selah .
before the mountains were brought forth , or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , thou art God .
Thou carriest them away as with a flood ; they are as a sleep : in the morning they are like grass which groweth up .
in the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and withereth .
for all our days are passed away in THY wrath : we spend our years as a tale that is told .
the days of our years are threescore years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands establish thou it .
he shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him .
for , lo , thine enemies , O Lord , for , lo , thine enemies shall perish ; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered .
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies , and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me .
the Lord reigneth , he is clothed with majesty ; the Lord is clothed with strength , wherewith he hath girded himself : the world also is stablished , that it cannot be moved .
the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters , yea , than the mighty waves of the sea .
he that planted the ear , shall he not hear ? he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
he that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ? he that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity , and shall cut them off in their own wickedness ; yea , the Lord our God shall cut them off .
for he is our God ; and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep of his hand . to day if ye will hear his voice ,
let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof .
the hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth .
O sing unto the Lord a new song ; for he hath done marvellous things : his right hand , and his holy arm , hath gotten him the victory .
the Lord hath made known his salvation : his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen .
he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel : all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
let the floods clap their hands : let the hills be joyful together
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way . O when wilt thou come unto me ? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart .
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes : I hate the work of them that turn aside ; it shall not cleave to me .
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour , him will I cut off : him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer .
mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me : he that walketh in a perfect way , he shall serve me .
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house : he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight .
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land ; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord .
hide not THY face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; incline thine ear unto me : in the day when I call answer me speedily .
Thou shalt arise , and have mercy upon Zion : for the time to favour her , yea , the set time , is come .
so the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord , and all the kings of the earth THY glory .
they shall perish , but thou shalt endure : yea , all of them shall wax old like a garment ; as a vesture shalt thou change them , and they shall be changed :
who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a flaming fire :
they go up by the mountains ; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them .
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man 's heart .
Thou hidest THY face , they are troubled : thou takest away their breath , they die , and return to their dust .
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live : I will sing praise to my God while I have my being .
that I may see the good of THY chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of THY nation , that I may glory with thine inheritance .
our fathers understood not THY wonders in Egypt ; they remembered not the multitude of THY mercies ; but provoked him at the sea , even at the Red sea .
he rebuked the Red sea also , and it was dried up : so he led them through the depths , as through the wilderness .
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan : and the land was polluted with blood .
save us , O Lord our God , and gather us from among the heathen , to give thanks unto THY holy name , and to triumph in THY praise .
and gathered them out of the lands , from the east , and from the west , from the north , and from the south .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
they mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths : their soul is melted because of trouble .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
let them exalt him also in the Congregation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the elders .
he blesseth them also , so that they are multiplied greatly ; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease .
Wilt not thou , O God , who hast cast us off ? and wilt not thou , O God , go forth with our hosts ?
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me : they have spoken against me with a lying tongue .
let there be none to extend mercy unto him : neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children .
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord ; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out .
as he loved cursing , so let it come unto him : as he delighted not in blessing , so let it be far from him .
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment , so let it come into his bowels like water , and like oil into his bones .
let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord , and of them that speak evil against my soul .
the Lord shall send the rod of THY strength out of Zion : rule thou in the midst of thine enemies .
THY people shall be willing in the day of THY power , in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning : thou hast the dew of THY youth .
he shall judge among the heathen , he shall fill the places with the dead bodies ; he shall wound the heads over many countries .
praise ye the Lord . I will praise the Lord with my whole heart , in the assembly of the upright , and in the Congregation .
he hath shewed his people the power of his works , that he may give them the heritage of the heathen .
from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord 's name is to be praised .
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill ;
not unto us , O Lord , not unto us , but unto THY name give glory , for THY mercy , and for THY truth 's sake .
the Lord hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel ; he will bless the house of Aaron .
the heaven , even the heavens , are the Lord 's : but the earth hath he given to the children of men .
because he hath inclined his ear unto me , therefore will I call upon him as long as I live .
they compassed me about ; yea , they compassed me about : but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
they compassed me about like bees ; they are quenched as the fire of thorns : for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
open to me the gates of righteousness : I will go into them , and I will praise the Lord :
blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord : we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord .
and take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth ; for I have hoped in THY judgments .
my hands also will I lift up unto THY commandments , which I have loved ; and I will meditate in THY statutes .
I am a companion of all them that fear thee , and of them that keep THY precepts .
let , I pray thee , THY merciful kindness be for my comfort , according to THY word unto THY servant .
let the proud be ashamed ; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause : but I will meditate in THY precepts .
THY testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever : for they are the rejoicing of my heart .
look thou upon me , and be merciful unto me , as thou usest to do unto those that love THY name .
the Lord shall preserve THY going out and THY coming in from this time forth , and even for evermore .
Whither the tribes go up , the tribes of the Lord , unto the testimony of Israel , to give thanks unto the name of the Lord .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
if it had not been the Lord who was on our side , when men rose up against us :
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
except the Lord build the house , they labour in vain that build it : except the Lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain .
it is vain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sorrows : for so he giveth his beloved sleep .
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them : they shall not be ashamed , but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate .
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
the Lord shall bless thee out of Zion : and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of THY life .
my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning : I say , more than they that watch for the morning .
Lord , remember David , and all his afflictions :
surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
the Lord hath sworn in truth unto David ; he will not turn from it ; Of the fruit of THY body will I set upon THY throne .
it is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron 's beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
as the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the Lord commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings for the rain ; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries .
by the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
if I do not remember thee , let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy .
though the Lord be high , yet hath he respect unto the lowly : but the proud he knoweth afar off .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive me : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and THY right hand shall save me .
if I ascend up into heaven , thou art there : if I make my bed in hell , behold , thou art there .
my substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
Thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in THY book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
if I should count them , they are more in number than the sand : when I awake , I am still with thee .
do not I hate them , O Lord , that hate thee ? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
the proud have hid a snare for me , and cords ; they have spread a net by the wayside ; they have set gins for me . Selah .
as for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
let not an evil speaker be established in the earth : evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
Incline not my heart to any evil thing , to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity : and let me not eat of their dainties .
when their judges are overthrown in stony places , they shall hear my words ; for they are sweet .
keep me from the snares which they have laid for me , and the gins of the workers of iniquity .
I cried unto the Lord with my voice ; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , then thou knewest my path . in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me .
I looked on my right hand , and beheld , but there was no man that would know me : refuge failed me ; no man cared for my soul .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
cause me to hear THY lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth ; that our daughters may be as corner stones , polished after the similitude of a palace :
that our garners may be full , affording all manner of store : that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets :
that our oxen may be strong to labour ; that there be no breaking in , nor going out ; that there be no complaining in our streets .
happy is that people , that is in such a case : yea , happy is that people , whose God is the Lord .
the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him , to all that call upon him in truth .
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him : he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
put not your trust in princes , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help .
the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind : the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down : the Lord loveth the righteous :
she crieth in the chief place of concourse , in the openings of the gates : in the city she uttereth her words , saying ,
turn you at my reproof : behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you , I will make known my words unto you .
but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it .
she is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her .
the is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her : and happy is every one that retaineth her .
when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and THY sleep shall be sweet .
withhold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of thine hand to do it .
the curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation of the just .
hear , O my son , and receive my sayings ; and the years of THY life shall be many .
when thou goest , THY steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
for they sleep not , except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall .
let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou ravished always with her love .
Thou art snared with the words of THY mouth , thou art taken with the words of THY mouth .
deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
when thou goest , it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest , it shall keep thee ; and when thou awakest , it shall talk with thee .
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry , with carved works , with fine linen of Egypt .
he goeth after her straightway , as an ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ;
she crieth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .
for wisdom is better than rubies ; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it .
when he prepared the heavens , I was there : when he set a compass upon the face of the depth :
when he gave to the sea his decree , that the waters should not pass his commandment : when he appointed the foundations of the earth :
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth ; and my delights were with the sons of men .
she hath killed her beasts ; she hath mingled her wine ; she hath also furnished her table .
give instruction to a wise man , and he will be yet wiser : teach a just man , and he will increase in learning .
the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish : but he casteth away the substance of the wicked .
he that gathereth in summer is a wise son : but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame .
in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found : but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding .
the fear of the wicked , it shall come upon him : but the desire of the righteous shall be granted .
the way of the Lord is strength to the upright : but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity .
a gracious woman retaineth honour : and strong men retain riches .
they that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord : but such as are upright in their way are his delight .
there is that scattereth , and yet increaseth ; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet , but it tendeth to poverty .
he that withholdeth corn , the people shall curse him : but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it .
he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind : and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart .
the words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood : but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them .
a man shall be commended according to his wisdom : but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised .
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth : and the recompence of a man 's hands shall be rendered unto him .
good understanding giveth favour : but the way of transgressors is hard .
a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children 's children : and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just .
in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride : but the lips of the wise shall preserve them .
in the multitude of people is the king 's honour : but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince .
he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding : but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth Folly .
wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding : but that which is in the midst of fools is made known .
the king 's favour is toward a wise servant : but his wrath is against him that causeth shame .
the way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns : but the way of the righteous is made plain .
a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth : and a word spoken in due season , how good is it !
every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord : though hand join in hand , he shall not be unpunished .
when a man 's ways please the Lord , he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him .
he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city .
a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it : whithersoever it turneth , it prospereth .
he that justifieth the wicked , and he that condemneth the just , even they both are abomination to the Lord .
even a fool , when he holdeth his peace , is counted wise : and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding .
he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster .
a man 's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth ; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled .
better is the poor that walketh in his integrity , than he that is perverse in his lips , and is a fool .
all the brethren of the poor do hate him : how much more do his friends go far from him ? he pursueth them with words , yet they are wanting to him .
the fear of the Lord tendeth to life : and he that hath it shall abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with evil .
a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom , and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again .
he that wasteth his father , and chaseth away his mother , is a son that causeth shame , and bringeth reproach .
the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion : whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul .
the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold ; therefore shall he beg in harvest , and have nothing .
love not sleep , lest thou come to poverty ; open thine eyes , and thou shalt be satisfied with bread .
the glory of young men is their strength : and the beauty of old men is the gray head .
the king 's heart is in the hand of the Lord , as the rivers of water : he turneth it whithersoever he will .
the way of man is froward and strange : but as for the pure , his work is right .
when the scorner is punished , the simple is made wise : and when the wise is instructed , he receiveth knowledge .
Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard .
the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the Congregation of the dead .
a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty , and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof .
train up a child in the way he should go : and when he is old , he will not depart from it .
he that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed ; for he giveth of his bread to the poor .
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child ; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him .
he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches , and he that giveth to the rich , shall surely come to want .
that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth ; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee ?
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not ? for riches certainly make themselves wings ; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven .
let not thine heart envy sinners : but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long .
look not thou upon the wine when it is red , when it giveth his colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright .
Yea , thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea , or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast .
they have stricken me , shalt thou say , and I was not sick ; they have beaten me , and I felt it not : when shall I awake ? I will seek it yet again .
so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto THY soul : when thou hast found it , then there shall be a reward , and THY expectation shall not be cut off .
rejoice not when thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth :
for there shall be no reward to the evil man ; the candle of the wicked shall be put out .
say not , I will do so to him as he hath done to me : I will render to the man according to his work .
and , lo , it was all grown over with thorns , and nettles had covered the face thereof , and the stone wall thereof was broken down .
for better it is that it be said unto thee , Come up hither ; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen .
go not forth hastily to strive , lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof , when THY neighbour hath put thee to shame .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to them that send him : for he refresheth the soul of his masters .
Hast thou found honey ? eat so much as is sufficient for thee , lest thou be filled therewith , and vomit it .
if thine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thirsty , give him water to drink :
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman and in a wide house .
he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
as he that bindeth a stone in a sling , so is he that giveth honour to a fool .
where no wood is , there the fire goeth out : so where there is no talebearer , the strife ceaseth .
Thine own friend , and THY father 's friend , forsake not ; neither go into THY brother 's house in the day of THY calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice , rising early in the morning , it shall be counted a curse to him .
though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle , yet will not his foolishness depart from him .
and thou shalt have goats ' milk enough for THY food , for the food of THY household , and for the maintenance for THY maidens .
for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof : but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged .
better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness , than he that is perverse in his ways , though he be rich .
he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer shall be abomination .
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way , he shall fall himself into his own pit : but the upright shall have good things in possession .
he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough .
he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him .
Whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , It is no transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer .
he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife : but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat .
he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool : but whoso walketh wisely , he shall be delivered .
he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length .
an unjust man is an abomination to the just : and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked .
Lest I be full , and deny thee , and say , Who is the Lord ? or lest I be poor , and steal , and take the name of my God in vain .
there is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their jaw teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
the eye that mocketh at his father , and despiseth to obey his mother , the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , and the young eagles shall eat it .
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
she riseth also while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household , and a portion to her maidens .
she stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .

the thing that hath been , it is that which shall be ; and that which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
and I turned myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and Folly : for what can the man do that cometh after the king ? even that which hath been already done .
the wise man 's eyes are in his head ; but the fool walketh in darkness : and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all .
Yea , I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun : because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me .
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured , and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun . this is also vanity .
therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun .
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
I have seen the travail , which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it .
he hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all his labour , it is the gift of God .
and moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that wickedness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity was there .
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts .
Yea , better is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
I considered all the living which walk under the sun , with the second child that shall stand up in his stead .
keep THY foot when thou goest to the house of God , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fools : for they consider not that they do evil .
be not rash with THY mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let THY words be few .
for a dream cometh through the multitude of business ; and a fool 's voice is known by multitude of words .
when thou vowest a vow unto God , defer not to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou hast vowed .
suffer not THY mouth to cause THY flesh to sin ; neither say thou before the angel , that it was an error : wherefore should God be angry at THY voice , and destroy the work of thine hands ?
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with their eyes ?
the sleep of a labouring man is sweet , whether he eat little or much : but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep .
as he came forth of his mother 's womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
and this also is a sore evil , that in all points as he came , so shall he go : and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind ?
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof : and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
in the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider : God also hath set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
all things have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness .
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all .
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of Folly , even of foolishness and madness :
which yet my soul seeketh , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
who is as the wise man ? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom maketh his face to shine , and the boldness of his face shall be changed .
all this have I seen , and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun : there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt .
and so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner do evil an hundred times , and his days be prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , which fear before him :
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before God .
when I applied mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done upon the earth : ( for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes : )
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and besieged it , and built great bulwarks against it :
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour : so doth a little Folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
if the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness : and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
a fool also is full of words : a man cannot tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
blessed art thou , O land , when THY king is the son of nobles , and THY princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
he that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap .
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun :
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be darkened ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern .
and moreover , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; yea , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many Proverbs .
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which was written was upright , even words of truth .
and further , by these , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
if thou know not , O thou fairest among women , go THY way forth by the footsteps of the flock , and feed THY kids beside the shepherds ' tents .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
I charge you , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart : behold , he standeth behind our wall , he looketh forth at the windows , shewing himself through the lattice .
the flowers appear on the earth ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ;
the fig tree putteth forth her green figs , and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell . arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether .
by night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not .
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not .
I charge you , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
he made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , O ye daughters of Zion , and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals , and in the day of the gladness of his heart .
THY teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn , which came up from the washing ; whereof every one bear twins , and none is barren among them .
THY lips are like a thread of scarlet , and THY speech is comely : THY temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within THY locks .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
Thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my spouse ; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes , with one chain of THY neck .
how fair is THY love , my sister , my spouse ! how much better is THY love than wine ! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices !
THY lips , O my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under THY tongue ; and the smell of THY garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
I have put off my coat ; how shall I put it on ? I have washed my feet ; how shall I defile them ?
I rose up to open to my beloved ; and my hands dropped with myrrh , and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh , upon the handles of the lock .
the watchmen that went about the city found me , they smote me , they wounded me ; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me .
what is THY beloved more than another beloved , O thou fairest among women ? what is THY beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge us ?
my beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
how beautiful are THY feet with shoes , O prince 's daughter ! the joints of THY thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a cunning workman .
THY neck is as a tower of Ivory ; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon , by the gate of Bath @-@ rabbim : THY nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus .
let us get up early to the vineyards ; let us see if the vine flourish , whether the tender grape appear , and the pomegranates bud forth : there will I give thee my loves .
O that thou wert as my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother ! when I should find thee without , I would kiss thee ; yea , I should not be despised .
I would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother 's house , who would instruct me : I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
who is this that cometh up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? I raised thee up under the apple tree : there THY mother brought thee forth : there she brought thee forth that bare thee .
we have a little sister , and she hath no breasts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ?
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal @-@ hamon ; he let out the vineyard unto keepers ; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
Ah sinful nation , a people laden with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , children that are corrupters : they have forsaken the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger , they are gone away backward .
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
your country is desolate , your cities are burned with fire : your land , strangers devour it in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
and the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as Sodom , and we should have been like unto Gomorrah .
when ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your hand , to tread my courts ?
bring no more vain oblations ; incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths , the calling of assemblies , I cannot away with ; it is iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
THY princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them .
and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together , and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
say ye to the righteous , that it shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their doings .
Woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his hands shall be given him .
therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion , and the Lord will discover their secret parts .
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man , saying , We will eat our own bread , and wear our own apparel : only let us be called by THY name , to take away our reproach .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Zion , and he that remaineth in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem :
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? wherefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
Woe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth !
Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that continue until night , till wine inflame them !
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
therefore my people are gone into captivity , because they have no knowledge : and their honourable men are famished , and their multitude dried up with thirst .
therefore hell hath enlarged herself , and opened her mouth without measure : and their glory , and their multitude , and their pomp , and he that rejoiceth , shall descend into it .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the mighty man shall be humbled , and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled :
that say , Let him make speed , and hasten his work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
their roaring shall be like a lion , they shall roar like young lions : yea , they shall roar , and lay hold of the prey , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
above it stood the seraphims : each one had six wings ; with twain he covered his face , and with twain he covered his feet , and with twain he did fly .
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
then flew one of the seraphims unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar :
and the Lord have removed men far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .
and say unto him , Take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
the Lord shall bring upon thee , and upon THY people , and upon THY father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall nourish a young cow , and two sheep ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria .
for the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
say ye not , A confederacy , to all them to whom this people shall say , A confederacy ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be afraid .
and he shall be for a sanctuary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and I will wait upon the Lord , that hideth his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion .
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and look upward .
the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light : they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hath the light shined .
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise , and garments rolled in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire : no man shall spare his brother .
Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees , and that write grievousness which they have prescribed ;
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
Howbeit he meaneth not so , neither doth his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few .
as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols , and whose Graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria ;
therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame : and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day ;
and shall consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body : and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off THY shoulder , and his yoke from off THY neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing .
as yet shall he remain at Nob that day : he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
behold , the Lord , the Lord of hosts , shall lop the bough with terror : and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down , and the haughty shall be humbled .
and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse , and a Branch shall grow out of his roots :
and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord ;
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing of his ears :
and the cow and the bear shall feed ; their young ones shall lie down together : and the lion shall eat straw like the ox .
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice ' den .
and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse , which shall stand for an ensign of the people ; to it shall the Gentiles seek : and his rest shall be glorious .
and he shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
the envy also of Ephraim shall depart , and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off : Ephraim shall not envy Judah , and Judah shall not vex Ephraim .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab ; and the children of Ammon shall obey them .
behold , God is my salvation ; I will trust , and not be afraid : for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song ; he also is become my salvation .
lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain , exalt the voice unto them , shake the hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
I have commanded my sanctified ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my highness .
they come from a far country , from the end of heaven , even the Lord , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
behold , the day of the Lord cometh , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land desolate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light : the sun shall be darkened in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to shine .
and I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity ; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease , and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible .
I will make a man more precious than fine gold ; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir .
therefore I will shake the heavens , and the earth shall remove out of her place , in the wrath of the Lord of hosts , and in the day of his fierce anger .
and it shall be as the chased roe , and as a sheep that no man taketh up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
every one that is found shall be thrust through ; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword .
their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished .
behold , I will stir up the Medes against them , which shall not regard silver ; and as for gold , they shall not delight in it .
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb ; their eye shall not spare children .
it shall never be inhabited , neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation : neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there ; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there .
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged .
for the Lord will have mercy on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the strangers shall be joined with them , and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob .
THY pomp is brought down to the grave , and the noise of THY viols : the worm is spread under thee , and the worms cover thee .
all the kings of the nations , even all of them , lie in glory , every one in his own house .
Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial , because thou hast destroyed THY land , and slain THY people : the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned .
prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
I will also make it a possession for the bittern , and pools of water : and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction , saith the Lord of hosts .
the Lord of hosts hath sworn , saying , surely as I have thought , so shall it come to pass ; and as I have purposed , so shall it stand :
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth : and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations .
rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed , and the needy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill THY root with famine , and he shall slay THY remnant .
the burden of Moab . because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
he is gone up to Bajith , and to Dibon , the high places , to weep : Moab shall howl over Nebo , and over Medeba : on all their heads shall be baldness , and every beard cut off .
in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth : on the tops of their houses , and in their streets , every one shall howl , weeping abundantly .
and Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
therefore the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away to the Brook of the willows .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab ; the howling thereof unto Eglaim , and the howling thereof unto Beer @-@ elim .
send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness , unto the mount of the daughter of Zion .
for it shall be , that , as a wandering bird cast out of the nest , so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
the cities of Aroer are forsaken : they shall be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress also shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , saith the Lord of hosts .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean .
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn , and reapeth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim .
at that day shall a man look to his Maker , and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel .
and he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the groves , or the images .
Woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise like the noise of the seas ; and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
and behold at eveningtide trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that spoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
for afore the harvest , when the bud is perfect , and the sour grape is ripening in the flower , he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and take away and cut down the branches .
and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be wasted and dried up .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up : the reeds and flags shall wither .
the fishers also shall mourn , and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament , and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish .
and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof , all that make sluices and ponds for fish .
the princes of Zoan are become fools , the princes of Noph are deceived ; they have also seduced Egypt , even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof .
the Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof : and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof , as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit .
in that day shall Egypt be like unto women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shaketh over it .
and the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt , every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself , because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts , which he hath determined against it .
in that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the Lord , and perform it .
in that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria , and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians .
so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners , and the Ethiopians captives , young and old , naked and barefoot , even with their buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
and he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen , a chariot of asses , and a chariot of camels ; and he hearkened diligently with much heed :
for they fled from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
for thus hath the Lord said unto me , Within a year , according to the years of an hireling , and all the glory of Kedar shall fail :
all THY rulers are fled together , they are bound by the archers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which have fled from far .
and it shall come to pass , that THY choicest valleys shall be full of chariots , and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and he discovered the covering of Judah , and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest .
Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool : but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof , neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago .
he will surely violently turn and Toss thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the chariots of THY glory shall be the shame of THY lord 's house .
and I will drive thee from THY station , and from THY state shall he pull thee down .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah :
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantity , from the vessels of cups , even to all the vessels of flagons .
be still , ye inhabitants of the isle ; thou whom the merchants of Zidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
he stretched out his hand over the sea , he shook the kingdoms : the Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strong holds thereof .
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
the earth is utterly broken down , the earth is clean dissolved , the earth is moved exceedingly .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
O Lord , thou art my God ; I will exalt thee , I will praise THY name ; for thou hast done wonderful things ; THY counsels of old are faithfulness and truth .
Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
he will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the Lord hath spoken it .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest , and Moab shall be trodden down under him , even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill .
and the fortress of the high Fort of THY walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the dust .
with my soul have I desired thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within me will I seek thee early : for when THY judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness .
let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the Lord .
like as a woman with child , that draweth near the time of her delivery , is in pain , and crieth out in her pangs ; so have we been in THY sight , O Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in pain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter thou into THY chambers , and shut THY doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast .
fury is not in me : who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle ? I would go through them , I would burn them together .
he shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root : Israel shall blossom and bud , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
yet the defenced city shall be desolate , and the habitation forsaken , and left like a wilderness : there shall the calf feed , and there shall he lie down , and consume the branches thereof .
Woe to the crown of pride , to the drunkards of Ephraim , whose glorious beauty is a fading flower , which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine !
in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people ,
and your Covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
for the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
when he hath made plain the face thereof , doth he not cast abroad the fitches , and scatter the cummin , and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and rie in their place ?
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff , and the cummin with a rod .
bread corn is bruised ; because he will not ever be threshing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .
and I will camp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with a mount , and I will raise forts against thee .
moreover the multitude of THY strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep , and hath closed your eyes : the prophets and your rulers , the seers hath he covered .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity , and out of darkness .
the meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant .
for the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem : thou shalt weep no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of THY cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Ye shall defile also the covering of THY Graven images of silver , and the ornament of THY molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender , which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
behold , the name of the Lord cometh from far , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a devouring fire :
yet he also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of them that work iniquity .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
when it shall hail , coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
and the people shall be as the burnings of lime : as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire .
he shall dwell on high : his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
Thou shalt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive ; of a stammering tongue , that thou canst not understand .
THY tacklings are loosed ; they could not well strengthen their mast , they could not spread the sail : then is the prey of a great spoil divided ; the lame take the prey .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hearken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
for the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations , and his fury upon all their armies : he hath utterly destroyed them , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
their slain also shall be cast out , and their stink shall come up out of their carcases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
and the unicorns shall come down with them , and the bullocks with the bulls ; and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatness .
it shall not be quenched night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it ; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion , and the stones of emptiness .
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom , but none shall be there , and all her princes shall be nothing .
and thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shall be an habitation of dragons , and a court for owls .
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island , and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
there shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and Hatch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vultures also be gathered , every one with her Mate .
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
and the parched ground shall become a pool , and the thirsty land springs of water : in the habitation of dragons , where each lay , shall be grass with reeds and rushes .
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah , and took them .
and the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army . and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field .
then came forth unto him Eliakim , Hilkiah 's son , which was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , Asaph 's son , the recorder .
I say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , Hear ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , The Lord will deliver us . Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
and it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
and he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , He is come forth to make war with thee . and when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not THY God , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed , as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Telassar ?
and Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
Incline thine ear , O Lord , and hear ; open thine eyes , O Lord , and see : and hear all the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have digged , and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places .
therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the Lord .
then the angel of the Lord went forth , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria : and I will defend this city .
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord , that the Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken ;
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness :
I said , I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord , in the land of the living : I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
I reckoned till morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my bones : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
O Lord , by these things men live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit : so wilt thou recover me , and make me to live .
behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind THY back .
the living , the living , he shall praise thee , as I do this day : the father to the children shall make known THY truth .
the Lord was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord .
for Isaiah had said , Let them take a lump of figs , and lay it for a plaister upon the boil , and he shall recover .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem , and cry unto her , that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned : for she hath received of the Lord 's hand double for all her sins .
behold , the Lord God will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young .
with whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of understanding ?
behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance : behold , he taketh up the isles as a very little thing .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a Graven image , that shall not be moved .
it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in :
he pursued them , and passed safely ; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet .
Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , Thou art my servant ; I have chosen thee , and not cast thee away .
behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
Thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers in high places , and fountains in the midst of the valleys : I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter , and as the Potter treadeth clay .
for I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counseller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
behold my servant , whom I uphold ; mine elect , in whom my soul delighteth ; I have put my spirit upon him : he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles .
he shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause his voice to be heard in the street .
a bruised Reed shall he not break , and the smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
I the Lord have called thee in righteousness , and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a Covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles ;
to open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
I will make waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will dry up the pools .
they shall be turned back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in Graven images , that say to the molten images , Ye are our gods .
since thou wast precious in my sight , thou hast been honourable , and I have loved thee : therefore will I give men for thee , and people for THY life .
I have declared , and have saved , and I have shewed , when there was no strange god among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , saith the Lord , that I am God .
Yea , before the day was I am he ; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand : I will work , and who shall let it ?
behold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of THY sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with THY sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground : I will pour my spirit upon THY seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring :
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , THY transgressions , and , as a cloud , THY sins : return unto me ; for I have redeemed thee .
I will go before thee , and make the crooked places straight : I will break in pieces the gates of brass , and cut in sunder the bars of iron :
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the Lord , which call thee by THY name , am the God of Israel .
for Jacob my servant 's sake , and Israel mine elect , I have even called thee by THY name : I have surnamed thee , though thou hast not known me .
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none beside me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
I have made the earth , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have I commanded .
they shall be ashamed , and also confounded , all of them : they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols .
assemble yourselves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations : they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their Graven image , and pray unto a god that cannot save .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
Hearken unto me , O house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , which are borne by me from the belly , which are carried from the womb :
THY nakedness shall be uncovered , yea , THY shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and I will not meet thee as a man .
I was wroth with my people , I have polluted mine inheritance , and given them into thine hand : thou didst shew them no mercy ; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid THY yoke .
and thou saidst , I shall be a lady for ever : so that thou didst not lay these things to THY heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
for thou hast trusted in THY wickedness : thou hast said , None seeth me . THY wisdom and THY knowledge , it hath perverted thee ; and thou hast said in thine heart , I am , and none else beside me .
Thou art wearied in the multitude of THY counsels . let now the astrologers , the stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee .
thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured , even THY merchants , from THY youth : they shall wander every one to his quarter ; none shall save thee .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my mouth , and I shewed them ; I did them suddenly , and they came to pass .
Thou hast heard , see all this ; and will not ye declare it ? I have shewed thee new things from this time , even hidden things , and thou didst not know them .
they are created now , and not from the beginning ; even before the day when thou heardest them not ; lest thou shouldest say , behold , I knew them .
Yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not ; yea , from that time that thine ear was not opened : for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously , and wast called a transgressor from the womb .
for my name 's sake will I defer mine anger , and for my praise will I refrain for thee , that I cut thee not off .
mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand hath spanned the heavens : when I call unto them , they stand up together .
I , even I , have spoken ; yea , I have called him : I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
THY seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of THY bowels like the gravel thereof ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he clave the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
listen , O isles , unto me ; and hearken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hath called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished Shaft ; in his quiver hath he hid me ;
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , even by the springs of water shall he guide them .
behold , these shall come from far : and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim .
for THY waste and THY desolate places , and the land of THY destruction , shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants , and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away .
the children which thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in thine ears , The place is too strait for me : give place to me that I may dwell .
I gave my back to the smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair : I hid not my face from shame and spitting .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a Flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
he is near that justifieth me ; who will contend with me ? let us stand together : who is mine adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord God will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you that feareth the Lord , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
Hearken to me , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek the Lord : look unto the rock whence ye are hewn , and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged .
Hearken unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
my righteousness is near ; my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the isles shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool : but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
art thou not it which hath dried the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over ?
therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return , and come with singing unto Zion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gladness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed , and that he should not die in the pit , nor that his bread should fail .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
these two things are come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? desolation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall I comfort thee ?
THY watchmen shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the Lord shall bring again Zion .
the Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
for ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rereward .
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; the kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
he was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth .
and he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and THY seed shall inherit the Gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed , saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee .
and I will make THY windows of agates , and THY gates of carbuncles , and all THY borders of pleasant stones .
in righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters , and he that hath no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord THY God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it .
neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the Lord , speak , saying , The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people : neither let the eunuch say , behold , I am a dry tree .
Yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that cannot understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
Thou art wearied in the greatness of THY way ; yet saidst thou not , There is no hope : thou hast found the life of thine hand ; therefore thou wast not grieved .
for I will not contend for ever , neither will I be always wroth : for the spirit should fail before me , and the souls which I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth , and smote him : I hid me , and was wroth , and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the lips ; Peace , peace to him that is far off , and to him that is near , saith the Lord ; and I will heal him .
Wherefore have we fasted , say they , and thou seest not ? wherefore have we afflicted our soul , and thou takest no knowledge ? behold , in the day of your fast ye find pleasure , and exact all your labours .
behold , ye fast for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
then shall THY light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and THY righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the Lord shall be THY rereward .
and if thou draw out THY soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul ; then shall THY light rise in obscurity , and THY darkness be as the noonday :
behold , the Lord 's hand is not shortened , that it cannot save ; neither his ear heavy , that it cannot hear :
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the night ; we are in desolate places as dead men .
for our transgressions are multiplied before thee , and our sins testify against us : for our transgressions are with us ; and as for our iniquities , we know them ;
Yea , truth faileth ; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey : and the Lord saw it , and it displeased him that there was no judgment .
and he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his arm brought salvation unto him ; and his righteousness , it sustained him .
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and an helmet of salvation upon his head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a cloke .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , fury to his adversaries , recompence to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompence .
for , behold , the darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the people : but the Lord shall arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen upon thee .
the multitude of camels shall cover thee , the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come : they shall bring gold and incense ; and they shall shew forth the praises of the Lord .
therefore THY gates shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles , and that their kings may be brought .
the glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee , the fir tree , the pine tree , and the box together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and I will make the place of my feet glorious .
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles , and shalt suck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that I the Lord am THY Saviour and THY Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
the sun shall be no more THY light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee : but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light , and THY God THY glory .
THY sun shall no more go down ; neither shall THY moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of THY mourning shall be ended .
THY people also shall be all righteous : they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers .
but ye shall be named the priests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles , and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves .
for your shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto them .
and their seed shall be known among the Gentiles , and their offspring among the people : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
and the Gentiles shall see THY righteousness , and all kings THY glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the Lord shall name .
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord , and a royal diadem in the hand of THY God .
but they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the Lord ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness .
go through , go through the gates ; prepare ye the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a standard for the people .
behold , the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world , Say ye to the daughter of Zion , behold , THY salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
and I will tread down the people in mine anger , and make them drunk in my fury , and I will bring down their strength to the earth .
as a beast goeth down into the valley , the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest : so didst thou lead THY people , to make thyself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of THY holiness and of THY glory : where is THY zeal and THY strength , the sounding of THY bowels and of THY mercies toward me ? are they restrained ?
when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for , thou camest down , the mountains flowed down at THY presence .
Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness , those that remember thee in THY ways : behold , thou art wroth ; for we have sinned : in those is continuance , and we shall be saved .
but we are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all do fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , have taken us away .
but now , O Lord , thou art our father ; we are the clay , and thou our Potter ; and we all are the work of THY hand .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burned up with fire : and all our pleasant things are laid waste .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people , which walketh in a way that was not good , after their own thoughts ;
which remain among the graves , and lodge in the monuments , which eat swine 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
and I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create : for , behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
and I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
and they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus saith the Lord , The heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : where is the house that ye build unto me ? and where is the place of my rest ?
that ye may suck , and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory .
for , behold , the Lord will come with fire , and with his chariots like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
for by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh : and the slain of the Lord shall be many .
and it shall come to pass , that from one new moon to another , and from one sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before me , saith the Lord .
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee ; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee , and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations .
but the Lord said unto me , Say not , I am a child : for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee , and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak .
then the Lord put forth his hand , and touched my mouth . and the Lord said unto me , behold , I have put my words in THY mouth .
see , I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
and I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , who have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
hear ye the word of the Lord , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel :
is Israel a servant ? is he a homeborn slave ? why is he spoiled ?
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the Lord THY God , when he led thee by the way ?
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
as the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ,
but where are THY gods that thou hast made thee ? let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of THY trouble : for according to the number of THY cities are THY gods , O Judah .
also in THY skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents : I have not found it by secret search , but upon all these .
yet thou sayest , Because I am innocent , surely his anger shall turn from me . behold , I will plead with thee , because thou sayest , I have not sinned .
Yea , thou shalt go forth from him , and thine hands upon thine head : for the Lord hath rejected THY confidences , and thou shalt not prosper in them .
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom , that she defiled the land , and committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against the Lord THY God , and hast scattered THY ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , saith the Lord .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers .
a voice was heard upon the high places , weeping and supplications of the children of Israel : for they have perverted their way , and they have forgotten the Lord their God .
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains : truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel .
declare ye in Judah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , blow ye the trumpet in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assemble yourselves , and let us go into the defenced cities .
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe unto us ! for we are spoiled .
for my people is foolish , they have not known me ; they are sottish children , and they have none understanding : they are wise to do evil , but to do good they have no knowledge .
I beheld , and , lo , the fruitful place was a wilderness , and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord , and by his fierce anger .
for this shall the earth mourn , and the heavens above be black : because I have spoken it , I have purposed it , and will not repent , neither will I turn back from it .
the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch their tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place .
and their houses shall be turned unto others , with their fields and wives together : for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , saith the Lord .
for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hearkened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
we have heard the fame thereof : our hands wax feeble : anguish hath taken hold of us , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side .
O daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallow thyself in ashes : make thee mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation : for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us .
stand in the gate of the Lord 's house , and proclaim there this word , and say , Hear the word of the Lord , all ye of Judah , that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord .
for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings ; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour ;
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , for ever and ever .
but go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh , where I set my name at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
and now , because ye have done all these works , saith the Lord , and I spake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not ;
therefore will I do unto this house , which is called by my name , wherein ye trust , and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers , as I have done to Shiloh .
and I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of Ephraim .
for I spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
for the children of Judah have done evil in my sight , saith the Lord : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to pollute it .
and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven , and for the beasts of the earth ; and none shall fray them away .
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whither I have driven them , saith the Lord of hosts .
I hearkened and heard , but they spake not aright : no man repented him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? every one turned to his course , as the horse rusheth into the battle .
Yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
how do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the Lord is with us ? Lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain .
the wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the Lord ; and what wisdom is in them ?
for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
for , behold , I will send Serpents , cockatrices , among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you , saith the Lord .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt ; I am black ; astonishment hath taken hold on me .
Oh that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fountain of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , saith the Lord .
take ye heed every one of his neighbour , and trust ye not in any brother : for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbour will walk with slanders .
and they will deceive every one his neighbour , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies , and weary themselves to commit iniquity .
their tongue is as an arrow shot out ; it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in heart he layeth his wait .
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the heathen , whom neither they nor their fathers have known : and I will send a sword after them , till I have consumed them .
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
yet hear the word of the Lord , O ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and every one her neighbour lamentation .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the workman , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of cunning men .
but the Lord is the true God , he is the living God , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion .
every man is brutish in his knowledge : every founder is confounded by the Graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the Lord of hosts is his name .
my tabernacle is spoiled , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
for the pastors are become brutish , and have not sought the Lord : therefore they shall not prosper , and all their flocks shall be scattered .
behold , the noise of the bruit is come , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah desolate , and a den of dragons .
O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of THY cities were THY gods , O Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing , even altars to burn incense unto Baal .
the Lord called THY name , A green olive tree , fair , and of goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine :
and there shall be no remnant of them : for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
Thou hast planted them , yea , they have taken root : they grow , yea , they bring forth fruit : thou art near in their mouth , and far from their reins .
for even THY brethren , and the house of THY father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee ; yea , they have called a multitude after thee : believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
I have forsaken mine house , I have left mine heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness : for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh shall have peace .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have plucked them out I will return , and have compassion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
take the girdle that thou hast got , which is upon THY loins , and arise , go to Euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
and it came to pass after many days , that the Lord said unto me , arise , go to Euphrates , and take the girdle from thence , which I commanded thee to hide there .
then I went to Euphrates , and digged , and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it : and , behold , the girdle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
and I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , saith the Lord : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy , but destroy them .
but if ye will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride ; and mine eye shall weep sore , and run down with tears , because the Lord 's flock is carried away captive .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Judah shall be carried away captive all of it , it shall be wholly carried away captive .
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee ? for thou hast taught them to be captains , and as chief over thee : shall not sorrows take thee , as a woman in travail ?
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the pits , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and confounded , and covered their heads .
because the ground is chapt , for there was no rain in the earth , the plowmen were ashamed , they covered their heads .
and I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
THY substance and THY treasures will I give to the spoil without price , and that for all THY sins , even in all THY borders .
and I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
for thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that bare them , and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land ;
and ye have done worse than your fathers ; for , behold , ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart , that they may not hearken unto me :
for mine eyes are upon all their ways : they are not hid from my face , neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes .
and first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double ; because they have defiled my land , they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things .
therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The Lord .
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is Graven upon the table of their heart , and upon the horns of your altars ;
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
as the partridge sitteth on eggs , and hatcheth them not ; so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the Lord , the fountain of living waters .
and say unto them , Hear ye the word of the Lord , ye kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus saith the Lord ; Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day , neither do ye any work , but hallow ye the sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
then I went down to the Potter 's house , and , behold , he wrought a work on the wheels .
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter : so he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ;
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
if it do evil in my sight , that it obey not my voice , then I will repent of the good , wherewith I said I would benefit them .
will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken ?
because my people hath forgotten me , they have burned incense to vanity , and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths , to walk in paths , in a way not cast up ;
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will shew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them : for they have digged a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the east gate , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee ,
they have built also the high places of Baal , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal , which I commanded not , nor spake it , neither came it into my mind :
then came Jeremiah from Tophet , whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house ; and said to all the people ,
now Pashur the son of Immer the priest , who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things .
then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . then said Jeremiah unto him , The Lord hath not called THY name Pashur , but Magor @-@ missabib .
but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
but , O Lord of hosts , that triest the righteous , and seest the reins and the heart , let me see THY vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
and let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew , and repented not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the shouting at noontide ;
because he slew me not from the womb ; or that my mother might have been my grave , and her womb to be always great with me .
and I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
behold , I am against thee , O inhabitant of the valley , and rock of the plain , saith the Lord ; which say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
but I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the Lord : and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it .
and say , Hear the word of the Lord , O king of Judah , that sittest upon the throne of David , thou , and THY servants , and THY people that enter in by these gates :
and I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down THY choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness , and his chambers by wrong ; that useth his neighbour 's service without wages , and giveth him not for his work ;
and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek THY life , and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest , even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
and I will cast thee out , and THY mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
is this man Coniah a despised broken idol ? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure ? wherefore are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
and I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , saith the Lord .
in his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely : and this is his name whereby he shall be called , the Lord our RIGHTEOUSNESS .
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for I will bring evil upon them , even the year of their visitation , saith the Lord .
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets ; behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land .
for who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord , and hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
behold , a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury , even a grievous whirlwind : it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked .
the anger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies ? yea , they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ;
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal .
the prophet that hath a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hath my word , let him speak my word faithfully . what is the chaff to the wheat ? saith the Lord .
and the burden of the Lord shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have perverted the words of the living God , of the Lord of hosts our God .
one basket had very good figs , even like the figs that are first ripe : and the other basket had very naughty figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
and I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ;
and the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the candle .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
and they shall drink , and be moved , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at the Lord 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the Lord had sent me :
to wit , Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ; as it is this day ;
Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ,
and all the kings of Tyrus , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea ,
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert ,
and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Ye shall certainly drink .
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and an howling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the Lord , saying ,
if so be they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings .
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;
when the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house unto the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the Lord your God ; and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , namely , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him into Egypt .
nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
and now have I given all these lands unto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
and all nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him .
therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
Yea , thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem ;
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ;
the prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the Lord hath truly sent him .
then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
( after that Jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , and the carpenters , and the Smiths , were departed from Jerusalem ; )
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) saying ,
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , unto all that are carried away captives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon ;
and seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the Lord for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
for thus saith the Lord , That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
and ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
because they have not hearkened to my words , saith the Lord , which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but ye would not hear , saith the Lord .
for it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord of hosts , that I will break his yoke from off THY neck , and will burst THY bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
why criest thou for thine affliction ? THY sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity : because THY sins were increased , I have done these things unto thee .
and out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
behold , the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury , a continuing whirlwind : it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of the Lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
again I will build thee , and thou shalt be built , O virgin of Israel : thou shalt again be adorned with THY tabrets , and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry .
Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria : the planters shall plant , and shall eat them as common things .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry , arise ye , and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God .
and I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Goodness , saith the Lord .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I did bear the reproach of my youth .
and there shall dwell in Judah itself , and in all the cities thereof together , husbandmen , and they that go forth with flocks .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
in those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten a sour grape , and the children 's teeth are set on edge .
but every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grape , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
thus saith the Lord ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , saith the Lord .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar .
for then the king of Babylon 's army besieged Jerusalem : and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon , and there shall he be until I visit him , saith the Lord : though ye fight with the Chaldeans , ye shall not prosper ?
and I subscribed the evidence , and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
so I took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and custom , and that which was open :
Ah Lord God ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by THY great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee :
Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them : the Great , the mighty God , the Lord of hosts , is his name ,
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even unto this day , and in Israel , and among other men ; and hast made thee a name , as at this day ;
and hast brought forth THY people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with great terror ;
and hast given them this land , which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey ;
therefore thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the Lord .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
Yea , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
and I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Again in this place , which is desolate without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof , shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The Lord our righteousness .
as the host of heaven cannot be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured : so will I multiply the seed of David my servant , and the Levites that minister unto me .
this is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habaziniah , and his brethren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , nor our daughters ;
but we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father , which he commanded them ; but this people hath not hearkened unto me :
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah : and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken unto him , upon a roll of a book .
and Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord 's house .
when Michaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord ,
then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe , and told all the words in the ears of the king .
yet they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
but the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet : but the Lord hid them .
then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned .
and king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the Lord , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah .
then Pharoah 's army was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from Jerusalem .
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
so they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the Lord , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and THY soul shall live .
so Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken : and he was there when Jerusalem was taken .
in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they beseiged it .
and in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah .
and the Chaldeans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of Jerusalem .
but Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
so Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard sent , and Nebushasban , Rab @-@ saris , and Nergal @-@ sharezer , Rabmag , and all the king of Babylon 's princes ;
even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
but I will deliver thee in that day , saith the Lord : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
for I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but THY life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put THY trust in me , saith the Lord .
even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , unto Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him , even with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned , and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah .
then they said to Jeremiah , The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord THY God shall send thee to us .
and it came to pass after ten days , that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn .
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the Lord , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tahpanhes .
take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets , rising early and sending them , saying , Oh , do not this abominable thing that I hate .
Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as at this day .
they are not humbled even unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
for I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence :
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord , we will not hearken unto thee .
then Jeremiah said unto all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
and this shall be a sign unto you , saith the Lord , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil :
against Egypt , against the army of Pharaoh @-@ necho king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah .
Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled Apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the Lord .
Egypt riseth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he saith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
the nations have heard of THY shame , and THY cry hath filled the land : for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty , and they are fallen both together .
the word that the Lord spake to Jeremiah the prophet , how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt .
declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes : say ye , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
for in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
and the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the Lord hath spoken .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will send unto him wanderers , that shall cause him to wander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles .
and judgment is come upon the plain country ; upon Holon , and upon Jahazah , and upon Mephaath ,
O ye that dwell in Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock , and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole 's mouth .
moreover I will cause to cease in Moab , saith the Lord , him that offereth in the high places , and him that burneth incense to his gods .
for every head shall be bald , and every beard clipped : upon all the hands shall be cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab , and in the streets thereof : for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure , saith the Lord .
Kerioth is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the mighty men 's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
flee ye , turn back , dwell deep , O inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him , the time that I will visit him .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
I have heard a rumour from the Lord , and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen , saying , Gather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall , at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
concerning Kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite , thus saith the Lord ; arise ye , go up to Kedar , and spoil the men of the east .
the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
they shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward , saying , Come , and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that shall not be forgotten .
remove out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the he goats before the flocks .
because ye were glad , because ye rejoiced , O ye destroyers of mine heritage , because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass , and Bellow as bulls ;
your mother shall be sore confounded ; she that bare you shall be ashamed : behold , the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly desolate : every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
and I will bring Israel again to his habitation , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : waste and utterly destroy after them , saith the Lord , and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the Lord .
Slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the Lord .
and the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all round about him .
their Redeemer is strong ; the Lord of hosts is his name : he shall throughly plead their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dried up : for it is the land of Graven images , and they are mad upon their idols .
behold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation , and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
the king of Babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands waxed feeble : anguish took hold of him , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
and will send unto Babylon fanners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine : and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host .
thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans , and they that are thrust through in her streets .
for Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of the Lord of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord 's hand , that made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunken of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding .
every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the Graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war : for with thee will I break in pieces the nations , and with thee will I destroy kingdoms ;
and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his Rider ; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his Rider ;
with thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ;
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the Lord .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion .
and the land shall tremble and sorrow : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon , to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken .
in their heat I will make their feasts , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the Lord .
her cities are a desolation , a dry land , and a wilderness , a land wherein no man dwelleth , neither doth any son of man pass thereby .
therefore , behold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Graven images of Babylon : and her whole land shall be confounded , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
Wherefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will do judgment upon her Graven images : and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
though Babylon should mount up to heaven , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall spoilers come unto her , saith the Lord .
because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do roar like great waters , a noise of their voice is uttered :
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was sore in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
and the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
and all the army of the Chaldeans , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about .
but Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen .
the caldrons also , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the bowls , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was Eighteen cubits ; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow .
so Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath . thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons :
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
and from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , and they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things : for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into THY Congregation .
the Lord is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
let all their wickedness come before thee ; and do unto them , as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
the Lord was as an enemy : he hath swallowed up Israel , he hath swallowed up all her palaces : he hath destroyed his strong holds , and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
mine eyes do fail with tears , my bowels are troubled , my liver is poured upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
they say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
THY prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee : and they have not discovered thine iniquity , to turn away THY captivity ; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
behold , O Lord , and consider to whom thou hast done this . shall the women eat their fruit , and children of a span long ? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
he hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hath made me desolate .
it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord .
he putteth his mouth in the dust ; if so be there may be hope .
Thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
how is the gold become dim ! how is the most fine gold changed ! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street .
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
her Nazarites were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk , they were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was of sapphire :
their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cleaveth to their bones ; it is withered , it is become like a stick .
they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger : for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field .
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the Lord hath accomplished his fury ; he hath poured out his fierce anger , and hath kindled a fire in Zion , and it hath devoured the foundations thereof .
the kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem .
for the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her ,
they have wandered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
the anger of the Lord hath divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the priests , they favoured not the elders .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our vain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
they hunt our steps , that we cannot go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come .
our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven : they pursued us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
rejoice and be glad , O daughter of Edom , that dwellest in the land of Uz ; the cup also shall pass through unto thee : thou shalt be drunken , and shalt make thyself naked .
we have given the hand to the Egyptians , and to the Assyrians , to be satisfied with bread .
also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . and this was their appearance ; they had the likeness of a man .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
as for their rings , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four .
Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal , stretched forth over their heads above .
and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads , when they stood , and had let down their wings .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house , ) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them .
and he said unto me , Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with my words unto them .
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels over against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel @-@ abib , that dwelt by the river of Chebar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered THY soul .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the Lord stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make THY tongue cleave to the roof of THY mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
and lay siege against it , and build a Fort against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set battering rams against it round about .
for I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days : so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
therefore thou shalt set THY face toward the siege of Jerusalem , and thine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of THY siege .
and THY meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
thus saith the Lord God ; This is Jerusalem : I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
and I will do in thee that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
moreover I will make thee waste , and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
and I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .
yet will I leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
also , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord God unto the land of Israel ; An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
now is the end come upon thee , and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to THY ways , and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations .
the morning is come unto thee , O thou that dwellest in the land : the time is come , the day of trouble is near , and not the sounding again of the mountains .
now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and I will judge thee according to THY ways , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness : none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of any of theirs : neither shall there be wailing for them .
they have blown the trumpet , even to make all ready ; but none goeth to the battle : for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his iniquity .
they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty : but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall pollute it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robbers shall enter into it , and defile it .
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be defiled .
Mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the ancients .
then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of Amber .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the plain .
so I went in and saw ; and behold every form of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , pourtrayed upon the wall round about .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord 's house which was toward the north ; and , behold , there sat women weeping for Tammuz .
and to the others he said in mine hearing , Go ye after him through the city , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity :
and as for me also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will recompense their way upon their head .
and , behold , the man clothed with linen , which had the inkhorn by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as thou hast commanded me .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
and when I looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
and as for their appearances , they four had one likeness , as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel .
when they went , they went upon their four sides ; they turned not as they went , but to the place whither the head looked they followed it ; they turned not as they went .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
and when the cherubims went , the wheels went by them : and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubims .
this is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar ; and I knew that they were the cherubims .
and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar , their appearances and themselves : they went every one straight forward .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
Ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
this city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel :
and they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence .
that they may walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the Lord God .
then did the cherubims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have ears to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebellious house .
then shalt thou bring forth THY stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for removing : and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into captivity .
and I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall scatter them among the nations , and disperse them in the countries .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he seeth is for many days to come , and he prophesieth of the times that are far off .
Ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
they have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , The Lord saith : and the Lord hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying divination , whereas ye say , The Lord saith it ; albeit I have not spoken ?
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
Lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ?
likewise , thou son of man , set THY face against the daughters of THY people , which prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy thou against them ,
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the Lord have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity : the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him ;
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , saith the Lord God .
though Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
and they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord God .
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
and say , Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem ; Thy birth and THY nativity is of the land of Canaan ; THY father was an Amorite , and THY mother an Hittite .
and as for THY nativity , in the day thou wast born THY navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of THY person , in the day that thou wast born .
and when I passed by thee , and saw thee polluted in thine own blood , I said unto thee when thou wast in THY blood , Live ; yea , I said unto thee when thou wast in THY blood , Live .
then washed I thee with water ; yea , I throughly washed away THY blood from thee , and I anointed thee with oil .
I clothed thee also with broidered work , and shod thee with badgers ' skin , and I girded thee about with fine linen , and I covered thee with silk .
I decked thee also with ornaments , and I put bracelets upon THY hands , and a chain on THY neck .
and I put a jewel on THY forehead , and earrings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thine head .
and THY renown went forth among the heathen for THY beauty : for it was perfect through my comeliness , which I had put upon thee , saith the Lord God .
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty , and playedst the harlot because of THY renown , and pouredst out THY fornications on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and of THY garments thou didst take , and deckedst THY high places with divers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
Thou hast also taken THY fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
moreover thou hast taken THY sons and THY daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of THY whoredoms a small matter ,
that thou hast slain my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
and in all thine abominations and THY whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of THY youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in THY blood .
Thou hast built THY high place at every head of the way , and hast made THY beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened THY feet to every one that passed by , and multiplied THY whoredoms .
Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians THY neighbours , great of flesh ; and hast increased THY whoredoms , to provoke me to anger .
Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians , because thou wast unsatiable ; yea , thou hast played the harlot with them , and yet couldest not be satisfied .
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ;
they give gifts to all whores : but thou givest THY gifts to all THY lovers , and hirest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for THY whoredom .
and the contrary is in thee from other women in THY whoredoms , whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms : and in that thou givest a reward , and no reward is given unto thee , therefore thou art contrary .
they shall also bring up a company against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones , and thrust thee through with their swords .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
Thou art THY mother 's daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of THY sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all THY ways .
behold , this was the iniquity of THY sister Sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
neither hath Samaria committed half of THY sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified THY sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done .
that thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
when THY sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and THY daughters shall return to your former estate .
that thou mayest remember , and be confounded , and never open THY mouth any more because of THY shame , when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the Lord God .
he cropped off the top of his young twigs , and carried it into a land of traffick ; he set it in a city of merchants .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
and hath taken of the king 's seed , and made a Covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the Covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
what mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
Hath oppressed the poor and needy , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed abomination ,
that hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , hath not defiled his neighbour 's wife ,
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , spoiled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
all his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and dieth in them ; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die .
because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit , and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt .
and he knew their desolate palaces , and he laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate , and the fulness thereof , by the noise of his roaring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him : he was taken in their pit .
and they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
but she was plucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
then said I unto them , cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes , and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
and I gave them my statutes , and shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
moreover also I gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them .
but I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , in whose sight I brought them out .
but I said unto their children in the wilderness , Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their judgments , nor defile yourselves with their idols :
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my judgments , but had despised my statutes , and had polluted my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out , will I rule over you :
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will I plead with you face to face .
like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I plead with you , saith the Lord God .
and I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant :
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
then said I , Ah Lord God ! they say of me , Doth he not speak parables ?
seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the Slayer .
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
thus saith the Lord God ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
I will overturn , overturn , overturn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him .
shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of THY nativity .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; THY blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for I the Lord have spoken it .
then say thou , Thus saith the Lord God , The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it , that her time may come , and maketh idols against herself to defile herself .
in thee have they set light by father and mother : in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger : in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow .
behold , therefore I have smitten mine hand at THY dishonest gain which thou hast made , and at THY blood which hath been in the midst of thee .
can thine heart endure , or can thine hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with thee ? I the Lord have spoken it , and will do it .
and I will scatter thee among the heathen , and disperse thee in the countries , and will consume THY filthiness out of thee .
and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
Yea , I will gather you , and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath , and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I the Lord have poured out my fury upon you .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I recompensed upon their heads , saith the Lord God .
and they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted : with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
and when her sister Aholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she , and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms .
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea .
so she discovered her whoredoms , and discovered her nakedness : then my mind was alienated from her , like as my mind was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
for she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
there , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will raise up THY lovers against thee , from whom THY mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ;
for thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest , into the hand of them from whom THY mind is alienated :
Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of THY sister Samaria .
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah , the lewd women .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them seethe the bones of it therein .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance ; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be covered .
son of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep , neither shall THY tears run down .
Forbear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head upon thee , and put on THY shoes upon THY feet , and cover not THY lips , and eat not the bread of men .
so I spake unto the people in the morning : and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
and your tires shall be upon your heads , and your shoes upon your feet : ye shall not mourn nor weep ; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities , and mourn one toward another .
for thus saith the Lord God ; Because thou hast clapped thine hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced in heart with all THY despite against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth @-@ jeshimoth , Baal @-@ meon , and Kiriathaim ,
unto the men of the east with the Ammonites , and will give them in possession , that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations .
thus saith the Lord God ; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended , and revenged himself upon them ;
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus , and break down her towers : I will also scrape her dust from her , and make her like the top of a rock .
he shall slay with the sword THY daughters in the field : and he shall make a Fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the buckler against thee .
and he shall set engines of war against THY walls , and with his axes he shall break down THY towers .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all THY streets : he shall slay THY people by the sword , and THY strong garrisons shall go down to the ground .
and I will cause the noise of THY songs to cease ; and the sound of THY harps shall be no more heard .
and I will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for I the Lord have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
thus saith the Lord God to Tyrus ; shall not the isles shake at the sound of THY fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
now shall the isles tremble in the day of THY fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at THY departure .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made THY benches of Ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim .
fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be THY sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee .
the inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were THY mariners : THY wise men , O Tyrus , that were in thee , were THY pilots .
they of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , THY men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth THY comeliness .
the men of Arvad with thine army were upon THY walls round about , and the Gammadims were in THY towers : they hanged their shields upon THY walls round about ; they have made THY beauty perfect .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were THY merchants : they traded in THY market wheat of Minnith , and Pannag , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they occupied with thee in lambs , and rams , and goats : in these were they THY merchants .
the ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in THY market : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
and all that handle the oar , the mariners , and all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust upon their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee , and gird them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing .
when THY wares went forth out of the seas , thou filledst many people ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of THY riches and of THY merchandise .
in the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters THY merchandise and all THY company in the midst of thee shall fall .
all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee , and their kings shall be sore afraid , they shall be troubled in their countenance .
by THY great wisdom and by THY traffick hast thou increased THY riches , and thine heart is lifted up because of THY riches :
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of THY wisdom , and they shall defile THY brightness .
they shall bring thee down to the pit , and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas .
Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee , I am God ? but thou shalt be a man , and no God , in the hand of him that slayeth thee .
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
Thou wast perfect in THY ways from the day that thou wast created , till iniquity was found in thee .
for I will send into her pestilence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel , nor any grieving Thorn of all that are round about them , that despised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord God .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that I am the Lord : because he hath said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their habitation ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
in that day will I cause the Horn of the house of Israel to bud forth , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
for the day is near , even the day of the Lord is near , a cloudy day ; it shall be the time of the heathen .
and the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
thus saith the Lord ; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the Lord God .
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it cometh .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches : so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied him .
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain , and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches :
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
thus saith the Lord God ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
I will also water with THY blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of thee .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause THY multitude to fall , the terrible of the nations , all of them : and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her : the daughters of the nations shall lament her : they shall lament for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , saith the Lord God .
it came to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , unto the nether parts of the earth , with them that go down into the pit .
they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword : draw her and all her multitudes .
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is Edom , her kings , and all her princes , which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with them that go down to the pit .
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warning ; if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered THY soul .
again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
for I will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
and when this cometh to pass , ( lo , it will come , ) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
and they were scattered , because there is no shepherd : and they became meat to all the beasts of the field , when they were scattered .
my sheep wandered through all the mountains , and upon every high hill : yea , my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth , and none did search or seek after them .
I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
and I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
and I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land : and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither bear the shame of the heathen any more .
and say unto it , Thus saith the Lord God ; behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
therefore , as I live , saith the Lord God , I will prepare thee unto blood , and blood shall pursue thee : sith thou hast not hated blood , even blood shall pursue thee .
and I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in THY hills , and in THY valleys , and in all THY rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all THY blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard them .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; I have lifted up mine hand , surely the heathen that are about you , they shall bear their shame .
for , behold , I am for you , and I will turn unto you , and ye shall be tilled and sown :
and I will multiply men upon you , all the house of Israel , even all of it : and the cities shall be inhabited , and the wastes shall be builded :
son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it :
and I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
but I had pity for mine holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen , whither they went .
for I will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep my judgments , and do them .
and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and ye shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will also save you from all your uncleannesses : and I will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
and I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
thus saith the Lord God ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
and the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by .
then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : I the Lord have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones ,
and caused me to pass by them round about : and , behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they were very dry .
thus saith the Lord God unto these bones ; behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and I will lay sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
so I prophesied as I was commanded : and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold a shaking , and the bones came together , bone to his bone .
and when I beheld , lo , the sinews and the flesh came up upon them , and the skin covered them above : but there was no breath in them .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it , and performed it , saith the Lord .
and David my servant shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my judgments , and observe my statutes , and do them .
be thou prepared , and prepare for thyself , thou , and all THY company that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all THY bands , and many people with thee .
thus saith the Lord God ; It shall also come to pass , that at the same time shall things come into THY mind , and thou shalt think an evil thought :
and thou shalt come from THY place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord God , that my fury shall come up in my face .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
and I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , saith the Lord God : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
and I will smite THY bow out of THY left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of THY right hand .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
and I will set my glory among the heathen , and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid upon them .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them , and hid my face from them .
after that they have borne their shame , and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me , when they dwelt safely in their land , and none made them afraid .
when I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations ;
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and every little chamber was one Reed long , and one Reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one Reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
he measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another : the breadth was five and twenty cubits , door against door .
and from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cubits eastward and northward .
and the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north , he measured the length thereof , and the breadth thereof .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
and at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they slew their sacrifices .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
after he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
and the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cubits .
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , an hundred cubits .
so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
the posts of the temple were squared , and the face of the sanctuary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
then he brought me forth into the utter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court , and over against the pavement which was for the utter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
for they were in three stories , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground .
and the wall that was without over against the chambers , toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
the chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
and the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house .
now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
this is the law of the house ; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy . behold , this is the law of the house .
and he said unto me , Son of man , thus saith the Lord God ; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
and thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok , which approach unto me , to minister unto me , saith the Lord God , a young bullock for a sin offering .
Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they did cleanse it with the bullock .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and thou shalt offer them before the Lord , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
and thou shalt say to the rebellious , even to the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God ; O ye house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
thus saith the Lord God ; No stranger , uncircumcised in heart , nor uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any stranger that is among the children of Israel .
and the Levites that are gone away far from me , when Israel went astray , which went astray away from me after their idols ; they shall even bear their iniquity .
but I will make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
they shall have linen bonnets upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary , unto the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , saith the Lord God .
of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length , with five hundred in breadth , square round about ; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an Homer : the measure thereof shall be after the Homer .
this is the oblation that ye shall offer ; the sixth part of an ephah of an Homer of wheat , and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an Homer of barley :
concerning the ordinance of oil , the bath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the Cor , which is an Homer of ten baths ; for ten baths are an Homer :
thus saith the Lord God ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish , and cleanse the sanctuary :
and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth , and for him that is simple : so shall ye reconcile the house .
in the first month , in the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
and the prince in the midst of them , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth .
and there was a row of building round about in them , round about them four , and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ancles .
again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
afterward he measured a thousand ; and it was a river that I could not pass over : for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed over .
now when I had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
and ye shall inherit it , one as well as another : concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers : and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of Hethlon , as men go to Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazar @-@ hatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran .
and the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
and by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh , and to the river toward the great sea .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of Simeon , one gate of Issachar , one gate of Zebulun .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred , with their three gates ; one gate of Gad , one gate of Asher , one gate of Naphtali .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , of Shadrach ; and to Mishael , of Meshach ; and to Azariah , of Abed @-@ nego .
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou seest , deal with THY servants .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
and in all matters of wisdom and understanding , that the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm .
and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon :
then Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
and he changeth the times and the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings : he giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding :
then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him , I have found a man of the captives of Judah , that will make known unto the king the interpretation .
Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ;
but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . THY dream , and the visions of THY head upon THY bed , are these ;
Thou , O king , sawest , and behold a great image . this great image , whose brightness was excellent , stood before thee ; and the form thereof was terrible .
this image 's head was of fine gold , his breast and his arms of silver , his belly and his thighs of brass ,
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands , which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay , and brake them to pieces .
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
then these men were bound in their coats , their hosen , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
and these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and the height thereof reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth :
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let a beast 's heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that thou sawest , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached unto the heaven , and the sight thereof to all the earth ;
it is thou , O king , that art grown and become strong : for THY greatness is grown , and reacheth unto heaven , and THY dominion to the end of the earth .
and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots ; THY kingdom shall be sure unto thee , after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule .
the king spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from heaven , saying , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to thee it is spoken ; The kingdom is departed from thee .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men : but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof .
I have even heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
Peres ; Thy kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with scarlet , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made a proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes , which should be over the whole kingdom ;
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , Know , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . now the king spake and said unto Daniel , Thy God whom thou servest continually , he will deliver thee .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting : neither were instruments of musick brought before him : and his sleep went from him .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
after this I beheld , and lo another , like a Leopard , which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl ; the beast had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spake : I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame .
I saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
I came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me , even unto me Daniel , after that which appeared unto me at the first .
and as I was considering , behold , an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
and out of one of them came forth a little Horn , which waxed exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the pleasant land .
and it waxed great , even to the host of heaven ; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground , and stamped upon them .
Yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practised , and prospered .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me upright .
and the rough goat is the king of Grecia : and the great Horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
and in the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors are come to the full , a king of fierce countenance , and understanding dark sentences , shall stand up .
and his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
we have sinned , and have committed iniquity , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even by departing from THY precepts and from THY judgments :
neither have we hearkened unto THY servants the prophets , which spake in THY name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of THY servant , and his supplications , and cause THY face to shine upon THY sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
and whiles I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
Yea , whiles I was speaking in prayer , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening oblation .
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , O Daniel , I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ;
then I lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and behold a certain man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz :
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
then said he , Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee ? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia : and when I am gone forth , lo , the prince of Grecia shall come .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
and when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it .
for the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches .
but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him : and he shall stand in the glorious land , which by his hand shall be consumed .
and in his estate shall stand up a vile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom : but he shall come in peaceably , and obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him , and shall be broken ; yea , also the prince of the Covenant .
and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully : for he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
Yea , they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow : and many shall fall down slain .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do exploits .
neither shall he regard the God of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god : for he shall magnify himself above all .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt : and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy , and utterly to make away many .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
many shall be purified , and made white , and tried ; but the wicked shall do wickedly : and none of the wicked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days .
but I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen .
then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of Jezreel .
plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
Lest I strip her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
and I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the Lord .
for I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth , and they shall no more be remembered by their name .
and I will betroth thee unto me for ever ; yea , I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness , and in judgment , and in lovingkindness , and in mercies .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without teraphim :
hear the word of the Lord , ye children of Israel : for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beasts of the field , and with the fowls of heaven ; yea , the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away .
therefore shalt thou fall in the day , and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night , and I will destroy THY mother .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God .
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom , nor your spouses when they commit adultery : for themselves are separated with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall .
they will not frame their doings to turn unto their God : for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the Lord .
they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord ; but they shall not find him ; he hath withdrawn himself from them .
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
therefore have I hewed them by the prophets ; I have slain them by the words of my mouth : and THY judgments are as the light that goeth forth .
when I would have healed Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered , and the wickedness of Samaria : for they commit falsehood ; and the thief cometh in , and the troop of robbers spoileth without .
and they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness : now their own doings have beset them about ; they are before my face .
they are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the Baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough , until it be leavened .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their Baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
they are all hot as an oven , and have devoured their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me .
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , yet he knoweth not .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their Congregation hath heard .
and they have not cried unto me with their heart , when they howled upon their beds : they assemble themselves for corn and wine , and they rebel against me .
set the trumpet to THY mouth . he shall come as an eagle against the house of the Lord , because they have transgressed my Covenant , and trespassed against my law .
THY calf , O Samaria , hath cast thee off ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it be ERE they attain to innocency ?
Yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
they shall not dwell in the Lord 's land ; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria .
what will ye do in the solemn day , and in the day of the feast of the Lord ?
the watchman of Ephraim was with my God : but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah : therefore he will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins .
though they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them , that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when I depart from them !
all their wickedness is in Gilgal : for there I hated them : for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their princes are revolters .
Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb .
Israel is an empty vine , he bringeth forth fruit unto himself : according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars ; according to the Goodness of his land they have made goodly images .
it shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb : Ephraim shall receive shame , and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
it is in my desire that I should chastise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows .
Ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou didst trust in THY way , in the multitude of THY mighty men .
therefore shall a tumult arise among THY people , and all THY fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Beth @-@ arbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat unto them .
they shall walk after the Lord : he shall roar like a lion : when he shall roar , then the children shall tremble from the west .
they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the Lord .
Ephraim feedeth on wind , and followeth after the east wind : he daily increaseth lies and desolation ; and they do make a Covenant with the Assyrians , and oil is carried into Egypt .
the Lord hath also a controversy with Judah , and will punish Jacob according to his ways ; according to his doings will he recompense him .
and I that am the Lord THY God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the days of the solemn feast .
therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted ; therefore have they forgotten me .
I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will I devour them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them .
the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him : he is an unwise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
they that dwell under his shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the corn , and grow as the vine : the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? prudent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the transgressors shall fall therein .
that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten ; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
he hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
Sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God , and cry unto the Lord ,
how do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
O Lord , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
a fire devoureth before them ; and behind them a flame burneth : the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness ; yea , and nothing shall escape them .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
neither shall one thrust another ; they shall walk every one in his path : and when they fall upon the sword , they shall not be wounded .
they shall run to and fro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall climb up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief .
the earth shall quake before them ; the heavens shall tremble : the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the stars shall withdraw their shining :
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the Lord your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
gather the people , sanctify the Congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that suck the breasts : let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which I sent among you .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the Lord your God , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come .
for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem ,
because ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things :
the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a people far off : for the Lord hath spoken it .
assemble yourselves , and come , all ye heathen , and gather yourselves together round about : thither cause THY mighty ones to come down , O Lord .
let the heathen be wakened , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat : for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about .
Egypt shall be a desolation , and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
and he said , The Lord will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn , and the top of Carmel shall wither .
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver them up to Edom :
and I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon , and I will turn mine hand against Ekron : and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish , saith the Lord God .
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Tyrus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom , and remembered not the brotherly Covenant :
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof , with shouting in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind :
but I will send a fire upon Moab , and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth : and Moab shall die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet :
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek : and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid , to profane my holy name :
also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
and I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazarites . is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? saith the Lord .
therefore the flight shall perish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the mighty deliver himself :
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
will a lion roar in the forest , when he hath no prey ? will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a snare from the earth , and have taken nothing at all ?
shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be evil in a city , and the Lord hath not done it ?
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; An adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down THY strength from thee , and THY palaces shall be spoiled .
that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , saith the Lord .
I have smitten you with blasting and mildew : when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased , the palmerworm devoured them : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the Lord .
seek the Lord , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and devour it , and there be none to quench it in Bethel .
for I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
as if a man did flee from a lion , and a bear met him ; or went into the house , and leaned his hand on the wall , and a serpent bit him .
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
take thou away from me the noise of THY songs ; for I will not hear the melody of THY viols .
Woe to them that are at ease in Zion , and trust in the mountain of Samaria , which are named chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel came !
pass ye unto Calneh , and see ; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great : then go down to Gath of the Philistines : be they better than these kingdoms ? or their border greater than your border ?
that lie upon beds of Ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
for , behold , the Lord commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me ; and , behold , he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mowings .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord God , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the Lord :
and though they go into captivity before their enemies , thence will I command the sword , and it shall slay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
for , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
in that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that the plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall melt .
and I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them , saith the Lord THY God .
but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea , and there was a mighty tempest in the sea , so that the ship was like to be broken .
nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous against them .
so they took up Jonah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from her raging .
and said , I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord , and he heard me ; out of the belly of hell cried I , and thou heardest my voice .
for thou hadst cast me into the deep , in the midst of the seas ; and the floods compassed me about : all THY billows and THY waves passed over me .
the waters compassed me about , even to the soul : the depth closed me round about , the weeds were wrapped about my head .
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever : yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption , O Lord my God .
so the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
for word came unto the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
therefore now , O Lord , take , I beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
so Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
the word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
for , behold , the Lord cometh forth out of his place , and will come down , and tread upon the high places of the earth .
and the mountains shall be molten under him , and the valleys shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , and as the waters that are poured down a steep place .
therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field , and as plantings of a vineyard : and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley , and I will discover the foundations thereof .
declare ye it not at Gath , weep ye not at all : in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust .
pass ye away , thou inhabitant of Saphir , having THY shame naked : the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth @-@ ezel ; he shall receive of you his standing .
O thou inhabitant of Lachish , bind the chariot to the swift beast : she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion : for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee .
Woe to them that devise iniquity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
the breaker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
and I said , Hear , I pray you , O heads of Jacob , and ye princes of the house of Israel ; Is it not for you to know judgment ?
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
then shall the seers be ashamed , and the diviners confounded : yea , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer of God .
but truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord , and of judgment , and of might , to declare unto Jacob his transgression , and to Israel his sin .
hear this , I pray you , ye heads of the house of Jacob , and princes of the house of Israel , that abhor judgment , and pervert all equity .
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever .
now gather thyself in troops , O daughter of troops : he hath laid siege against us : they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth : then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord , in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
and I will pluck up THY groves out of the midst of thee : so will I destroy THY cities .

Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
trust ye not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide : keep the doors of THY mouth from her that lieth in THY bosom .
for the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man 's enemies are the men of his own house .
I will bear the indignation of the Lord , because I have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousness .
the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
they shall lick the dust like a serpent , they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth : they shall be afraid of the Lord our God , and shall fear because of thee .
he will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
God is Jealous , and the Lord revengeth ; the Lord revengeth , and is furious ; the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserveth wrath for his enemies .
the Lord is slow to anger , and great in power , and will not at all acquit the wicked : the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
he rebuketh the sea , and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the rivers : Bashan languisheth , and Carmel , and the flower of Lebanon languisheth .
the mountains quake at him , and the hills melt , and the earth is burned at his presence , yea , the world , and all that dwell therein .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
the Lord is good , a strong hold in the day of trouble ; and he knoweth them that trust in him .
but with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof , and darkness shall pursue his enemies .
for while they be folden together as thorns , and while they are drunken as drunkards , they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry .
thus saith the Lord : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have afflicted thee , I will afflict thee no more .
he that dasheth in pieces is come up before THY face : keep the munition , watch the way , make THY loins strong , fortify THY power mightily .
for the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel : for the emptiers have emptied them out , and marred their vine branches .
the shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken .
the chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall justle one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like torches , they shall run like the lightnings .
and Huzzab shall be led away captive , she shall be brought up , and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves , tabering upon their breasts .
take ye the spoil of silver , take the spoil of gold : for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture .
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with ravin .
the noise of a whip , and the noise of the rattling of the wheels , and of the pransing horses , and of the jumping chariots .
the Horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear : and there is a multitude of slain , and a great number of carcases ; and there is none end of their corpses ; they stumble upon their corpses :
behold , I am against thee , saith the Lord of hosts ; and I will discover THY skirts upon THY face , and I will shew the nations THY nakedness , and the kingdoms THY shame .
and I will cast abominable Filth upon thee , and make thee vile , and will set thee as a gazingstock .
all THY strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .
THY crowned are as the locusts , and THY captains as the great grasshoppers , which camp in the hedges in the cold day , but when the sun ariseth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
behold ye among the heathen , and regard , and wonder marvellously : for I will work a work in your days , which ye will not believe , though it be told you .
for , lo , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs .
their horses also are swifter than the leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves : and their horsemen shall spread themselves , and their horsemen shall come from far ; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat .
they shall come all for violence : their faces shall sup up as the east wind , and they shall gather the captivity as the sand .
and they shall scoff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scorn unto them : they shall deride every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
and makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
they take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am reproved .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .

for the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
behold , is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity ?
Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink , that puttest THY bottle to him , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
and his brightness was as the light ; he had horns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
was the Lord displeased against the rivers ? was thine anger against the rivers ? was THY wrath against the sea , that thou didst ride upon thine horses and THY chariots of salvation ?
THY bow was made quite naked , according to the oaths of the tribes , even THY word . Selah . Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers .
the mountains saw thee , and they trembled : the overflowing of the water passed by : the deep uttered his voice , and lifted up his hands on high .
the sun and moon stood still in their habitation : at the light of thine arrows they went , and at the shining of THY glittering spear .
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of THY people , even for salvation with thine anointed ; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by discovering the foundation unto the neck . Selah .
Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages : they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me : their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly .
hold THY peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice , he hath bid his guests .
therefore their goods shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation : they shall also build houses , but not inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , but not drink the wine thereof .
the great day of the Lord is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the Lord : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of wasteness and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of clouds and thick darkness ,
seek ye the Lord , all ye meek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek meekness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord 's anger .
the Lord will be terrible unto them : for he will famish all the gods of the earth ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the isles of the heathen .
she obeyed not the voice ; she received not correction ; she trusted not in the Lord ; she drew not near to her God .
I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the Lord .
the remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the Lord THY God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .

out of him came forth the corner , out of him the nail , out of him the battle bow , out of him every oppressor together .

the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel , saith the Lord , which stretcheth forth the heavens , and layeth the foundation of the earth , and formeth the spirit of man within him .

this shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HOLINESS unto the Lord ; and the pots in the Lord 's house shall be like the bowl 's before the altar .

behold , I will corrupt your seed , and spread Dung upon your faces , even the Dung of your solemn feasts ; and one shall take you away with it .

now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy ghost .
then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
and he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
when they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .

and Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
and seeing the multitudes , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him :
neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
for I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
and if THY right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of THY members should perish , and not that THY whole body should be cast into hell .
and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away THY coat , let him have THY cloke also .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .

and why beholdest thou the mote that is in THY brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
or how wilt thou say to THY brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of THY brother 's eye .
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat :
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
and I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
and Jesus said unto the centurion , Go THY way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
and when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and sick of a fever .
when the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :

and , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
and , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
but Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; THY faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
and Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .

and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
what I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
for I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
the blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
for this is he , of whom it is written , behold , I send my messenger before THY face , which shall prepare THY way before thee .
Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
but I say unto you , That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
all things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .

a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
he answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
for whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
for verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . this is he which received seed by the way side .
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :

is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? is thine eye evil , because I am good ?
and the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the Son of David : blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
but when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
but when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
but as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
and Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
for as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the Ark ,
but know this , that if the Goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
and the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood .
then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
and after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
and they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
and straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a Reed , and gave him to drink .
and , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
in the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre .
and , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
and the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye : for I know that ye seek Jesus , which was crucified .
and as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . and they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
and there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
and John was clothed with Camel 's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
and straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him :
now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
and when he had gone a little further thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
and forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
and there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
and straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
and it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
and it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
and it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
and some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
and he said unto them , unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables :
and when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
and they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
and they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the Legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
and they laughed him to scorn . but when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
and the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
and the Apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
for laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
for from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
and from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
and when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
and again , departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
and they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
so they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
and he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
and Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , whom do men say that I am ?
and he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's , the same shall save it .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
and he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
and if THY hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
for every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
and he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
they said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on THY right hand , and the other on THY left hand , in THY glory .
but Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
and they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
and many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
and they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord :
and Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
and again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
and they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? but he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it .
and Jesus answering said unto them , render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . and they marvelled at him .
for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
and then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
so ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
after two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
and wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the Goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
and he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
and there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and THY speech agreeth thereto .
and there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
and they bring him unto the place golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull .
and the superscription of his accusation was written over , the King of the Jews .
and when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
and they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
so then after the Lord had spoken unto them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God .
there was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
and the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak unto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings .
and when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
and it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
and , behold , thou shalt conceive in THY womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name Jesus .
and , behold , THY cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
for , lo , as soon as the voice of THY salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
and it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus , that all the world should be taxed .
and Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
and , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
and , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy ghost was upon him .
and it was revealed unto him by the Holy ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
for mine eyes have seen THY salvation ,
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
and it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
as it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
and Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of ER ,
which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi ,
which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim ,
which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David ,
which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of salmon , which was the son of Naasson ,
which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda ,
which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech ,
which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan ,
and the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
and Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord THY God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
and all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
and rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
and he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . and Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
and it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gennesaret ,
for he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
and , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
and Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
and it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away THY cloke forbid not to take THY coat also .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in THY brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like :
and they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
this is he , of whom it is written , behold , I send my messenger before THY face , which shall prepare THY way before thee .
for I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat .
and it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him ,
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
they on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
and that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
when they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
and it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
and , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
and when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately .
and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
and whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
and the Apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father 's , and of the holy angels .
but I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
and when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
and it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
but he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
for the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . go not from house to house .
for I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
and he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be THY name . THY kingdom come . THY will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
and forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . and lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
and he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . and it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , THY whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , THY body also is full of darkness .
if THY whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
and as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
and I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
if then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
and this know , that if the Goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
and that servant , which knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
and , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity Eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
and it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
and answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
and he arose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
and bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
it was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this THY brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
and he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of THY stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
and he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
and will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
and when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . and it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
and he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
for as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
and as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the Ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise also as it was in the days of lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
for it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
and it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
and when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at THY house .
and Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord ; behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold .
for I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this THY day , the things which belong unto THY peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
for the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
and shall lay thee even with the ground , and THY children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of THY visitation .
and he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
but he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
but woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
and there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
when they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives .
and when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest 's house . and Peter followed afar off .
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
and when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
and Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus .
for , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , this IS the King of the Jews .
and , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counseller ; and he was a good man , and a just :
( the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
it was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the Apostles .
and it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
and , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
and it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .
but as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
and the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
and he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
after this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
and when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
that which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
if I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heavenly things ?
and no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
he that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
Jesus saith unto him , Go THY way ; THY son liveth . and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
and as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth .
now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
and therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
but I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
all that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
and this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
it is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
it is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
this they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . but Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
when he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
but the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
but by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
these words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
the man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
the thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
and other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
no man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this commandment have I received of my Father .
and I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
my Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand .
then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
the Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
and the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
he that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
after that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a Sop , when I have dipped it . and when he had dipped the Sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye cannot come ; so now I say to you .
in my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
he that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's which sent me .
but the Comforter , which is the Holy ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
abide in me , and I in you . as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
I am the vine , ye are the branches : he that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
these things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
but when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
at that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you :
I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
I have manifested THY name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept THY word .
for I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
as soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
and Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
when Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
and Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , Jesus of NAZARETH the King of the Jews .
this title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
and there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
and seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
and when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
and it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved .
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with THY countenance .
therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ;
therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
for the promise is unto you , and to your children , and to all that are afar off , even as many as the Lord our God shall call .
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
for Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
and it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , shall be destroyed from among the people .
Yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
and Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
and when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
but a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
and by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in Solomon 's porch .
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem , bringing sick folks , and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the Apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
and the word of God increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
and they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and dwelt in Charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , wherein ye now dwell .
and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge , said God : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
and were carried over into Sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem .
I have seen , I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , I will send thee into Egypt .
this Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
he brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
this is that Moses , which said unto the children of Israel , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
saying unto Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : for as for this Moses , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness , as he had appointed , speaking unto Moses , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
but he , being full of the Holy ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
and Saul was consenting unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria , except the Apostles .
for unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
and they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
the place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
and he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
and when they were come up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
and Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
and when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
and he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
and it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
and there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
and forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
and when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
on the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
and he became very hungry , and would have eaten : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ,
and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said , behold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
and as Peter was coming in , Cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
and he commanded us to preach unto the people , and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead .
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy ghost .
upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas , that he should go as far as Antioch .
and there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
and he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
and when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose surname was Mark ; where many were gathered together praying .
and when Herod had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the keepers , and commanded that they should be put to death . and he went down from Judaea to Caesarea , and there abode .
and upon a set day Herod , arrayed in royal apparel , sat upon his throne , and made an oration unto them .
and when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
and when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar @-@ Jesus :
but when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
and afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of CIS , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
for so hath the Lord commanded us , saying , I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles , that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth .
and it came to pass in Iconium , that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spake , that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed .
and when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles , and also of the Jews with their rulers , to use them despitefully , and to stone them ,
and there sat a certain man at Lystra , impotent in his feet , being a cripple from his mother 's womb , who never had walked :
and when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
which when the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of , they rent their clothes , and ran in among the people , crying out ,
Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the Apostles and elders about this question .
and when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the Apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
now therefore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
then came he to Derbe and Lystra : and , behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timotheus , the son of a certain woman , which was a Jewess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
and as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decrees for to keep , that were ordained of the Apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem .
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
and suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one 's bands were loosed .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
( for all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
for as I passed by , and beheld your devotions , I found an altar with this inscription , TO the unknown God . whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare I unto you .
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
that they should seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , Graven by art and man 's device .
because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
and he departed thence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named Justus , one that worshipped God , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
and Crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia , the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and Gallio cared for none of those things .
but bade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem : but I will return again unto you , if God will . and he sailed from Ephesus .
and after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
this man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
after these things were ended , Paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
and the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
and certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day 's uproar , there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse .
when he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
and we sailed thence , and came the next day over against Chios ; and the next day we arrived at Samos , and tarried at Trogyllium ; and the next day we came to Miletus .
for Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons ,
serving the Lord with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews :
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
and now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
for I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto Coos , and the day following unto Rhodes , and from thence unto Patara :
and when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , besought him not to go up to Jerusalem .
there went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea , and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
and as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
and some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
and it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon , suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
and they gave him audience unto this word , and then lifted up their voices , and said , away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not fit that he should live .
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
so the chief captain then let the young man depart , and charged him , See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
who , when they came to Caesarea , and delivered the epistle to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of THY clemency a few words .
then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
and when Felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , When Lysias the chief captain shall come down , I will know the uttermost of your matter .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
at midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
but shewed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of Judaea , and then to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
and when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
and entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
but after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , Sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
and now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
but when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
and when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
and when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and laid them on the fire , there came a viper out of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
and it came to pass , that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
and from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum , and The three taverns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
so , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
and thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
( for not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
for when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara 's womb :
now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him ;
and hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy ghost which is given unto us .
for if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam 's transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
but God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
for that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I hate , that do I.
for the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do .
now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
for if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body , ye shall live .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint @-@ heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
for we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
who is he that condemneth ? it is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
that is , They which are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the seed .
for he saith to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion .
for he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth .
what shall we say then ? that the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
for they being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God .
that if thou shalt confess with THY mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
and how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
but Esaias is very bold , and saith , I was found of them that sought me not ; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me .
but what saith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal .
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh , and might save some of them .
for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
and be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
be of the same mind one toward another . mind not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . be not wise in your own conceits .
the night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
for whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
but why dost thou judge THY brother ? or why dost thou set at nought THY brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
it is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby THY brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
and I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ 's sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ;
for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
but now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
for it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
for Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ;
and base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are :
and I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
for what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
every man 's work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
if any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours ;
let a man so account of us , as of the ministers of Christ , and stewards of the mysteries of God .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
for who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
but I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are puffed up , but the power .
it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father 's wife .
and ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
and God hath both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
Defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
but and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
but to the rest speak I , not the Lord : if any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
for what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save THY husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save THY wife ?
for he that is called in the Lord , being a servant , is the Lord 's Freeman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is Christ 's servant .
I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
but meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter ?
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
what is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
and unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
to the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
but I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lord 's table , and of the table of devils .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
but if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
for first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
when ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord 's Supper .
and if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . and the rest will I set in order when I come .
for as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is Christ .
charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies , they shall fail ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall vanish away .
when I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man understandeth him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
so likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
else when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at THY giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
if any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
if any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
for I am the least of the Apostles , that am not meet to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
and if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
then cometh the end , when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
and that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory .
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
as touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia :
who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
and whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
and our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth .
for if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
and I wrote this same unto you , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
for to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
to whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ;
to the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven :
we are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new .
now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you in Christ 's stead , be ye reconciled to God .
( for he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )
great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
for , when we were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were fightings , within were fears .
for if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
and this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
and herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
for if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
yet have I sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
but this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; )
casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ;
for though I should boast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction , I should not be ashamed :
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
but we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you : for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ :
not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man 's line of things made ready to our hand .
but I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely ?
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a Thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
and he said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness . most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ? forgive me this wrong .
for though he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
examine yourselves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . know ye not your own selves , how that Jesus Christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
but if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
O foolish Galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth , crucified among you ?
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
now I say , That the heir , as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ;
Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting .
and let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
in whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy Apostles and prophets by the Spirit ;
Whereof I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power .
having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
for the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
for we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
put on the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
for God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
but I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ;
for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
but if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
for he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
though I might also have confidence in the flesh . if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , I more :
not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus .
( for many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which ye have to all the saints ,
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son :
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven .
who now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the church :
for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
for though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ :
buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
for I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
and when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
for our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God @-@ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the Apostles of Christ .
so being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
for ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
for verily , when we were with you , we told you before that we should suffer tribulation ; even as it came to pass , and ye know .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
but I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope .
for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord , that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep .
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the Archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
but let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
we are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ;
remember ye not , that , when I was yet with you , I told you these things ?
and we have confidence in the Lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
and if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who hath enabled me , for that he counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry ;
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an Apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
but I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
for bodily exercise profiteth little : but godliness is profitable unto all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
let no man despise THY youth ; but be thou an example of the believers , in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity .
rebuke not an elder , but intreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ;
but if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in THY grandmother Lois , and THY mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner : but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God ;
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
and they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned unto fables .
the cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
to Titus , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour .
for this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them slip .
Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
but we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession .
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe .
but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God :
for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
for if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law :
for finding fault with them , he saith , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah :
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
for there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
which had the golden censer , and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron 's rod that budded , and the tables of the Covenant ;
the Holy ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
for if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
for the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
by faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
by faith Jacob , when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
by faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
by faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
( of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ;
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
and this word , Yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which cannot be shaken may remain .
remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting Covenant ,
if any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
but every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
for if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he being not a Forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
if any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man 's religion is vain .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
for in many things we offend all . if any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body .
for every kind of beasts , and of birds , and of Serpents , and of things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind :
Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
behold , we count them happy which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren , see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently :
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
for so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ;
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
for after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands :
for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous , and his ears are open unto their prayers : but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil .
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
but rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ 's sufferings ; that , when his glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
but let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men 's matters .
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God ?
and when the chief shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility : for God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
but the God of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
and beside this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ;
for if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
but he that lacketh these things is blind , and cannot see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
having eyes full of adultery , and that cannot cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; Cursed children :
which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
while they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Saviour :
but the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
but , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
the Lord is not Slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us @-@ ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
and account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
Ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us : and truly our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ .
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
my little children , these things write I unto you , that ye sin not . and if any man sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous :
he that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
he that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . for this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
we know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . he that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
but whoso hath this world 's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
and this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
in this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us . God is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him .
if a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
by this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his commandments .
and this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us :
and if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
and this is love , that we walk after his commandments . this is the commandment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
if there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
which have borne witness of THY charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called :
I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed them that believed not .
who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
and he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
and when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . and he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , Fear not ; I am the first and the last :
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write ; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks ;
and hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
and unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ; These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
I know THY works , and charity , and service , and faith , and THY patience , and THY works ; and the last to be more than the first .
he that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
and immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
and all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
and I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the lamb .
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
and the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel 's hand .
the first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the Scorpions of the earth have power .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
and they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
for their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto Serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
and I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
and there was given me a Reed like unto a rod : and the angel stood , saying , Rise , and measure the temple of God , and the altar , and them that worship therein .
but the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them , and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
and after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
and the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child .
and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
and the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
and the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
and I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast : and they worshipped the beast , saying , Who is like unto the beast ? who is able to make war with him ?
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
and he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
and he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
here is wisdom . let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six .
and I looked , and , lo , a lamb stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father 's name written in their foreheads .
and I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great Thunder : and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps :
and in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of God .
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
and I looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
and the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
and after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
and the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
and I heard the angel of the waters say , Thou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
and men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the name of God , which hath power over these plagues : and they repented not to give him glory .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , It is done .
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials , and talked with me , saying unto me , Come hither ; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters :
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
and upon her forehead was a name written , mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of HARLOTS and ABOMINATIONS of the Earth .
and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus : and when I saw her , I wondered with great admiration .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have received no kingdom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast .
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
and the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and in her was found the blood of prophets , and of saints , and of all that were slain upon the earth .
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .
and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away .
and the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the Reed , twelve thousand furlongs . the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
and he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
and the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass .
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the lamb is the light thereof .
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it .
and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there .
and he shewed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb .
and there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
and there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light : and they shall reign for ever and ever .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
and , behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
