and this is the fashion which th@@ ou s@@ halt make it of : the length of the Ar@@ k shall be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , the b@@ read@@ th of it fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of it thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham built an alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar upon the wood .
is not this it in which my lor@@ d drin@@ ket@@ h , and where@@ by indeed he di@@ vin@@ eth ? ye have done ev@@ il in so doing .
for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will say of the children of Israel , They are ent@@ ang@@ led in the land , the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness hat@@ h shut them in .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt make an alt@@ ar to bur@@ n incen@@ se upon : of sh@@ it@@ tim wood s@@ halt th@@ ou make it .
and it shall come to pass , while my gl@@ ory pass@@ eth by , that I will put the@@ e in a cli@@ ft of the rock , and will cover the@@ e with my hand while I pass by :
and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold within and without , and made a cro@@ wn of gold to it round about .
and the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of his ep@@ ho@@ d , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work there@@ of ; of gold , blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer an offering un@@ to the Lord before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; blood shall be imp@@ uted un@@ to that man ; he hat@@ h shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall commit any of these ab@@ omin@@ ations , even the so@@ ul@@ s that commit them shall be cut off from among their people .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordin@@ ance , that ye commit not any one of these ab@@ omin@@ able customs , which were committed before you , and that ye def@@ ile not yo@@ ur@@ selves there@@ in : I am the Lord your God .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her si@@ ck@@ ness , and shall un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; he hat@@ h discovered her fo@@ un@@ tain , and she hat@@ h uncovered the fo@@ un@@ tain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and for@@ be@@ aret@@ h to keep the pass@@ over , even the same sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
and it came to pass on the tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cl@@ oud was taken up from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony .
but the sou@@ l that do@@ eth ought pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a st@@ ran@@ ger , the same re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
but the man that shall be un@@ clean , and shall not pur@@ ify himself , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , because he hat@@ h def@@ iled the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord : the water of separation hat@@ h not been sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon him ; he is un@@ clean .
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of them shall be pri@@ cks in your eyes , and thor@@ ns in your sides , and shall ve@@ x you in the land where@@ in ye d@@ well .
un@@ to a st@@ ran@@ ger th@@ ou may@@ est lend upon us@@ ury ; but un@@ to TH@@ Y brother th@@ ou s@@ halt not lend upon us@@ ury : that the Lord TH@@ Y God may b@@ less the@@ e in all that th@@ ou set@@ test th@@ ine hand to in the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
for the Lord your God dri@@ ed up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which he dri@@ ed up from before us , until we were gone over :
for the Lord hat@@ h driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hat@@ h been able to stand before you un@@ to this day .
and I brought you into the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might poss@@ ess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all that op@@ pressed you , and dra@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
Wil@@ t not th@@ ou poss@@ ess that which Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h TH@@ Y go@@ d gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess ? so wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us , them will we poss@@ ess .
so the mes@@ sen@@ ger went , and came and she@@ wed David all that Jo@@ a@@ b had sent him for .
and against the wall of the house he built ch@@ ambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle : and he made ch@@ ambers round about :
and under the bri@@ m of it round about there were k@@ n@@ ops comp@@ ass@@ ing it , ten in a cu@@ bit , comp@@ ass@@ ing the sea round about : the k@@ n@@ ops were cast in two ro@@ ws , when it was cast .
nevertheless he cle@@ av@@ ed un@@ to the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , which made Israel to sin ; he depar@@ ted not there@@ from .
and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of , and sav@@ ed himself there , not once nor twice .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , which made Israel to sin ; he depar@@ ted not there@@ from .
and he built the city round about , even from Mil@@ lo round about : and Jo@@ a@@ b rep@@ aired the rest of the city .
but David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under : because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heav@@ ens .
and he made the v@@ ail of blue , and pur@@ ple , and cri@@ m@@ son , and fine lin@@ en , and w@@ rought ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms there@@ on .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hear@@ ts un@@ to the God of their fa@@ thers .
Es@@ ther had not yet she@@ wed her kin@@ d@@ red nor her people ; as Mor@@ dec@@ ai had charged her : for Es@@ ther did the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , like as when she was brought up with him .
so the posts that ro@@ de upon mu@@ les and ca@@ me@@ ls went out , being has@@ tened and pressed on by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment . and the decree was given at Sh@@ us@@ han the palace .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of hell comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : the s@@ nar@@ es of death prevented me .
T@@ ho@@ u art my hiding place ; th@@ ou s@@ halt preserve me from trouble ; th@@ ou s@@ halt comp@@ ass me about with songs of deliver@@ ance . Se@@ lah .
for in@@ num@@ er@@ able ev@@ ils have comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore should I fear in the days of ev@@ il , when the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of my he@@ els shall comp@@ ass me about ?
all nations comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them .
they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about ; ye@@ a , they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast bes@@ et me behind and before , and laid th@@ ine hand upon me .
bring my sou@@ l out of prison , that I may praise TH@@ Y name : the righ@@ te@@ ous shall comp@@ ass me about ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt deal boun@@ ti@@ fully with me .
prepare TH@@ Y work without , and make it fit for th@@ y@@ self in the field ; and afterwards build th@@ ine house .
bring no more v@@ ain ob@@ lations ; incen@@ se is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to me ; the new mo@@ ons and sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , the calling of assemb@@ lies , I can@@ not away with ; it is in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , even the so@@ lem@@ n meeting .
the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds with their f@@ loc@@ ks shall come un@@ to her ; they shall pit@@ ch their ten@@ ts against her round about ; they shall fe@@ ed every one in his place .
for this city hat@@ h been to me as a provoc@@ ation of mine an@@ ger and of my fur@@ y from the day that they built it even un@@ to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
then s@@ halt th@@ ou bring forth TH@@ Y stu@@ ff by day in their sight , as stu@@ ff for removing : and th@@ ou s@@ halt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into cap@@ tivity .
and I will make the@@ e like the top of a rock : th@@ ou s@@ halt be a place to spread n@@ ets upon ; th@@ ou s@@ halt be built no more : for I the Lord have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
there is E@@ dom , her kings , and all her pr@@ inces , which with their might are laid by them that were sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with them that go down to the p@@ it .
and within were ho@@ oks , an hand broad , fas@@ tened round about : and upon the tables was the f@@ les@@ h of the offering .
and they consider not in their hear@@ ts that I remember all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : now their own do@@ ings have bes@@ et them about ; they are before my face .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as cor@@ n is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least gra@@ in fall upon the ear@@ th .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st strike through with his st@@ aves the head of his villages : they came out as a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind to sc@@ at@@ ter me : their re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing was as to dev@@ our the poor secre@@ tly .
and they took coun@@ sel , and bought with them the P@@ ot@@ ter 's field , to bur@@ y st@@ ran@@ gers in .
and hearing the multi@@ tude pass by , he asked what it meant .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other dis@@ cip@@ le , which was known un@@ to the high pri@@ est , and sp@@ ake un@@ to her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
( for as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us . )
and they also , if they abide not still in un@@ belief , shall be gra@@ ff@@ ed in : for God is able to gra@@ ff them in again .
if any thing be revealed to another that sit@@ te@@ th by , let the first hold his peace .
