And that 's not all .
Students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States .
Indeed , the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
Active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progresses , they will be offered treatment .
`` Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer '' it is also said .
But let 's suppose that it really is the Higgs , since the chances of being mistaken seem slim , and see what it is .
However , even though particle physics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pauli exclusion principle , which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same `` quantum state '' - this `` state '' consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
Based on this , physicists classify particles into two categories .
These bosons are then divided into two groups , according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mesons , which we will not discuss here , and `` force particles '' by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related .
Just imagine ...
`` What I want most is to be cured of my diarrhoea , it 's humiliating '' he confided .
`` It depends on the person 's ability '' to accept the regression , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such regression .
`` I have fine children '' she adds .
At Victor = Gadbois , a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding .
According to Elsie Monereau , Palliative Care Director with the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , physicians then often resort to palliative sedation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either sporadically or permanently .
The Charbonneau Commission `` has already brought down two mayors '' he adds , hoping that it will succeed in `` revealing the schemes behind the individuals . ''
Mayor of the borough of Rivière = des = Prairies , to the East of the island , she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resold for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that `` officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars , '' but he is especially concerned about the role of `` elected people aware of the scheme , '' when they were not up to their necks in the scam !
Although this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal , Mr Duchesneau invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ...
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .

Did the good draw ( 1 = 1 ) snatched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e = mail .
Computers `` take '' the new transaction and add a number to it , then `` hash '' it all up .
But cash also has this weakness .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can `` photograph and recognise '' says Pierre Noizat , who confirms he has thousands of users .

Nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
In the meantime , most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
On the first day of the law 's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake .
According to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is `` black archaeology . ''
`` The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why periodically , when the crime detection rate is low , it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants , '' says the consultant .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .

According to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to January = October 2011 , amounting to 22,900 , while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.8 % .
On this day , some employees of the Walmart corporation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left = wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low = to = medium incomes .
So many low = paid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace .
Walmart supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation .
In total , its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
Protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Walmart ( they ' re not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they do n't exist here yet ) , but McDonald 's and other cheap restaurants .

After 10 hours , the newborns experienced complete atrophy of instincts .
`` We bred chicks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , '' says Vladimir Sychev , confirming the failure of the experiment with chicks in space .
Water imitates weightlessness .
In other words , if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth 's pull .
Stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weightlessness ; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced .
`` And this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handicapped , completely unadapted human to earth , '' predicts Chairman of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igor Pestov .
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .

On the eve , the 20th of December , at 9pm , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , Brno , and Ostrava .
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
For example , in Prague , Chinaski , Support Lesbiens , Illustratosphere with Dan Barta , The Tap Tap , Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will appear .
In May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line = up with some interesting guests .
I began my job as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
In 1937 , the concept of a photoelectric homing rocket designed by engineer Rohozinski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Rocket - air torpedo and flying rocket = bomb appeared , authored by Leliwy = Krywoblocki .
He served in this capacity until his death in 1959 .
Last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works .
The resolution caused lively public debate .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the drop in social standards .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
If it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Brazilian , Turkish , Moroccan , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages .
Real power does not come from the people as the Western = style constitutions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
Among these astronomically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the puppet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am unsure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Rothschilds .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state = issued ) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war reparations for World War II were layed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's hotbed .
Their ordeal provoked a wave of solidarity and anti = Iranian feelings at home .
The debacle in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Carter 's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections .
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , " informed Nacher .
The lobby 's interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and `` anomalous curvature . ''
The EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so = called buy = out interventions , the state 's warehouses were full and were forced to export .
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea .
Funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , Pavel Nemec ( US = DEU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
Emotions flare among Czechs when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
Carlsbad wafers , Pohorelicky and Trebonsky carp , and Zatec hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world = renowned feta cheese and gorgonzola , German marzipan from Lubeck , and Parma ham .
The problem is political squabbling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .

And with the judging panel still looking at him with bewilderment , shrugging their shoulders , the impertinent Maas stacked his chosen props by order of size to form a pyramid and rounded off his presentation - now suitably backed up with action - with the words : `` Dear Municipality ! ''
The broad , laminated wood glue beams positioned at right = angles to the glass facade , provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight .
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts .
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ?
Pattloch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
The CTMO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment .
In the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CTMO , almost one third more than in 2010 .
This is a record and means that China , for the tenth time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
The CTMO trademark office then also dismissed the Munich = based company 's appeal .
In the next two instances , Freudenberg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day .

For almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in men that have intercourse with other men .
The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
In this country , human papilloma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
The number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
Which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease ?
Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .

Incidentally , no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women .
Equally dubious is the formulation stating that `` insulting people '' is forbidden .

Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Manning 's confinement was harsh
In Friday 's hearing , Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico 's brig , where he was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses .
When Fein asked about the forms Friday , Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as `` excellent '' and treatment by the facility overall as `` very professional . ''
`` They would write down ' no issues ' ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it did n't necessarily mean I did n't bring something up , '' Manning said .
Under questioning from the judge Friday , Manning said that he inferred from his guard 's order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
That night , Manning testified , his underwear , flip = flops and glasses were removed from his cell .
But I do n't have the vocabulary of a native , and I ca n't shake my American accent .
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican president = elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that is n't sufficiently Mexican .
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular despot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
In diplomatic terms , America is as steadfast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
Israel 's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
It is the world 's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .

`` The government should have just banned them altogether and then we 'd go OK , fine , we ' re done , we 'll shut up shop , '' he said , throwing his hands up in the air .
But increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of boredom .
And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days , we do n't experience the benefits of boredom .
But I 'll get back to that .
The ones who heard the low = level TV reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to boredom .
Professor Eastwood agreed .
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado 's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
At the same time , several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state = licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities .
`` This thing is evolving so quickly that I do n't know what 's going to happen next , '' said Daniel J. Oates , the police chief in Aurora , just east of Denver .
But no place or system , Mr. Smith conceded , can do more than suggest what might work .
`` There 's no real precedent for us to follow , '' he said .
After the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
The police in Grand Junction , the county 's largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts .

`` Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety ''
`` At least they do n't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet , like some beautiful pop music celebrities do , '' says Baroness Fiona Thyssen = Bornemisza .
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous , sixty = foot long catwalk which offers a role reversal : visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the catwalk while looking at a dream `` audience '' wearing Valentino masterpieces , for example , the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis , the costume Monica Vitti wore in `` La Notte '' and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba .
`` I prefer him to other designers because of his femininity , his great love of women , and because he enhances our beauty '' added the former Duchess of Feria .
`` Valentino is indifferent to fashion , his obsession is timeless '' says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .

`` They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences '' he adds .
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth UNASUR Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Presidential and Chancellery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website .
When asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President , Ollanta Humala , during a brief statement to the press .
`` Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts '' added Piñera , greeting Humala with a handshake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
Paraguay , which was suspended by UNASUR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo , was not involved in the meeting .
With Europe in crisis , `` economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a triumphalist attitude but should serve to expand its productive matrix and glimpse a better future for its people '' Humala added .
`` With President Ortega , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible '' said Santos .
`` That would complicate the health of any person '' he added .

Specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in Jalisco ( COESIDA ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fabrizio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Kaposi sarcoma , a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications .
`` I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person '' said Fabrizio , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with MILENIO JALISCO , to motivate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
In places dedicated to this task `` the distribution of condoms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us packets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms '' he said .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code , the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit , based in New Orleans , states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in Mexico .
For now , the Gonzalez Sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .

`` We do n't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world does n't come to an end '' said Restall .
`` I 'd never heard of a class that could teach it '' he said .
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Restall .
But he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world .
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , `` people will immediately start thinking of the next date '' or philosophising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven = year period after which the world will end .
