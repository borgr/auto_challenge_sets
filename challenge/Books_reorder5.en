 A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. 
 So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows. 
 "Boh! Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty. 
 I said. "You are like a murderer--you are like a slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!" 
 Won't I tell mama? but first--" He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing. 
 I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort. 
 I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. 
 In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands. 
 "But it was always in her," was the reply. "I've told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. 
 The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. 
 This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be so seldom entered. 
 I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. 
 Returning, I had to cross before the looking- glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. 
 All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference, all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. 
 I could not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly. 
 My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire. 
 This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm. 
 Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? 
 Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered. 
 "What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily. 
 I cannot endure it--let me be punished some other way! 
 Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without farther parley. 
 In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire. 
 It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed- foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow, leaning over me. 
 Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be rough. "I will try." 
 "You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better soon, no doubt." 
 Missis was rather too hard." 
 "Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c. 
 For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by dread: such dread as children only can feel. 
 This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! 
 I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so. 
 "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary; Long is the way, and the mountains are wild; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary Over the path of the poor orphan child. 
 Why did they send me so far and so lonely, Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled? 
 Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child. 
 Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing, Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild, God, in His mercy, protection is showing, Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child. 
 Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing, Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled, Still will my Father, with promise and blessing, Take to His bosom the poor orphan child. 
 Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall. 
 "No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things." 
 "Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that." 
 "Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition." "Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot. 
 I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast. 
 When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. 
 It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation. 
 "No? oh, shocking! 
 I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. 
 "This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. 
 "Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election." 
 "I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome." 
 In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. 
 My look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. 
 Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued-- 
 I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. 
 People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. _You_ are deceitful!" 
 "But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little." 
 A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction. 
 I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. 
 The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. 
 "Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go." 
 "I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread." 
 "If you dread them they'll dislike you." 
 "I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down." 
 Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. 
 There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. 
 Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions. 
 I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind. 
 The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and air. 
 A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound. 
 I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before. 
 Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. 
 Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest. 
 Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received me last night. 
 I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps. 
 The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice. 
 When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. 
 I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. 
 I returned it to her; she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her-- 
 "Both died before I can remember." 
 I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day's fare would be like this. 
 I asked of myself. "Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. 
 She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her. 
 Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. 
 "Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief to your relations. 
 Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered king! 
 "A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. 
 "You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are but a little untaught girl." 
 "But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly. 
 In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments. 
 Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening. 
 Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. 
 Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this sentence. 
 I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but rather to converse with her own thoughts. 
 Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. 
 We set out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed. 
 It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services. 
 How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back! 
 But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores. 
 Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever. 
 He paused. 
 Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. 
 Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?" 
 Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? 
 I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly. 
 He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence. 
 Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation. 
 Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case." 
 What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feeling bore me up! 
 It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. 
 I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. 
 Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. 
 "Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die. 
 She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. 
 "Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much." 
 Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared. 
 We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. 
 "Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else, will now think me wicked." 
 "I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now." 
 Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence. 
 She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart-- 
 That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks of skeletons. 
 Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at night. 
 The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. 
 Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay. 
 She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning. 
 This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instantly now! 
 It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. 
 I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word. 
 Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and looked in. 
 My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death. 
 I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table. 
 "Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?" 
 It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it strike some minutes since." 
 We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. 
 I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. 
 I walked about the chamber most of the time. 
 My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. 
 I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther! 
 And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. 
 How I wished sleep would silence her. It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief. 
 I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a response, and quickly. 
 Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed. 
 This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep. 
 She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive). 
 "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, --- shire." 
 At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E. 
 I longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least. 
 Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town." 
 "Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?" 
 Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother. 
 "You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued Mrs. Leaven. 
 "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth." 
 It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always quarrelling--" 
 I knew you would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or not. 
 There was something I wanted to ask you. 
 Have you ever heard anything from your father's kinsfolk, the Eyres?" 
 "An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did tell me--" 
 Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my mind. 
 At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn. 
 I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again. 
 How far are we on our road now, I wonder?" 
 The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said-- 
 "You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now." 
 "I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon." 
 First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs. 
 It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. 
 "I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?" 
 This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry." Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine." 
 "Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!' She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me to raise my voice at the question. 
 In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes. 
 "In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I. 
 Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind." 
 I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him." 
 The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. 
 I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. 
 "Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs. 
 Grace curtseyed silently and went in. 
 The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below. 
 Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence. 
 When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. 
 This was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!" 
 "Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an involuntary "Ugh!" 
 "I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse." 
 You are--" He stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a lady's-maid. 
 In two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move. 
 I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to do it, I was disposed to obey. 
 Having once caught the bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain. 
 Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side- door, and went in. 
 Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. 
 I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come. 
 "Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained." 
 I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside. 
 In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude. 
 You had better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. 
 Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence. 
 I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond. 
 I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. 
 He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. 
 "I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally thought pleasant things." 
 We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot. 
 No wonder you have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that sort of face. 
 "I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement." 
 "I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. 
 He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew." 
 It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. 
 Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise patchwork." 
 "Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my questions. 
 "I should think it may have: I should hope--better." He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately. 
 "You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed. 
 "Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his spirits unequal." 
 "Why, no--perhaps not. 
 He is not very forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. 
 In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him. 
 Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid. 
 Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is. 
 I continually forget them. 
 Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. 
 By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water." 
 He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived, knitting-basket in hand. 
 Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?" 
 "Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder." 
 "Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed? 
 It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of you--therefore speak." 
 Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?" 
 "No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily." 
 "I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary." 
 Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant. 
 Little girl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?" 
 You would say you don't see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language). 
 You would say, I should have been superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was not. 
 When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I degenerated. 
 "Repentance is said to be its cure, sir." 
 Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I _will_ get it, cost what it may." 
 "It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir." 
 "You have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries." 
 "I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence." 
 "And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. 
 You seem to doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that both are right." 
 "They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules." 
 "You are human and fallible." "I am: so are you--what then?" 
 "If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for sense. 
 My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day). 
 'Il faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed out of the room. 
 And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming-- 
 I have been green, too, Miss Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me. 
 I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I'll explain all this some day. 
 I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. 
 Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. 
 The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me." 
 A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe. 
 The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. 
 I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish. 
 I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way. 
 Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them frequently before me. 
 He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others. 
 He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. 
 I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged. 
 I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it. 
 Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks. 
 I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the smoke had stupefied him. 
 He took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water. 
 If you are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on. 
 I must pay a visit to the second storey. 
 "I hope it is he," thought I, "and not something worse." He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. 
 "I have found it all out," said he, setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought." 
 "No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground." 
 He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in both his own. 
 I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye. 
 During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day. 
 She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. 
 She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then she answered-- 
 "The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to hear. 
 She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?" 
 The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard. 
 "On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door." 
 "Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!" 
 "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. 
 I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed. 
 "I am hot, Adele, with stooping!" She went on sketching; I went on thinking. 
 And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments. 
 Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six. 
 "You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate so little at dinner. 
 "Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? 
 I believe there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and others." 
 I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen." 
 You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and be ashamed! 
 No snivel!--no sentiment!--no regret! I will endure only sense and resolution. 
 I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart. 
 Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. 
 Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter. "It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction. 
 "Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either. 
 And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations. 
 Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies. 
 "Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. 
 And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote. 
 I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able for anything. 
 "Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all the money she gets." 
 Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them. 
 Adele, too, would be dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least. 
 "Here he is!" said she. "Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?" 
 Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets. 
 "Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below. 
 I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering. 
 Besides, she added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors quel dommage!" 
 The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. 
 If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy.'" 
 I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress. 
 But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary. 
 Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip. 
 It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with an air. 
 I presently perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good- natured. 
 I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me. 
 Sir George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee- cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. 
 "Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her just now--is she gone? 
 You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition." 
 "I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking straight before him. 
 You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?" 
 The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated her question with an explanation. 
 What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! 
 Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?" "My lily-flower, you are right now, as always." 
 She appeared to be on her high horse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed. 
 Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty! 
 As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage! 
 I grant an ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the _gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a man." 
 "Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how such things _should_ be done." 
 "Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance." 
 I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester. 
 Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect it. 
 He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose. 
 He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. 
 The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink." 
 "An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate." 
 There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. 
 This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could not charm him_. 
 If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. 
 Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. 
 "Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so near to him?" 
 I asked myself. "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not like him with true affection! 
 If she did, she need not coin her smiles so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart. 
 I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of marrying for interest and connections. 
 All their class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom. 
 His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at least so I thought. The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. 
 But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. 
 The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome." 
 "To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to throw away such a chance of fun." 
 "My darling Blanche! recollect--" 
 "Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. 
 Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned. 
 "She won't come now," said he. "She says it's not her mission to appear before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words). 
 "You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches. Be advised, my angel girl--and--" 
 Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of his men. 
 The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library- door again opened. 
 Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further conversation. 
 I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. 
 A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body. 
 They affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what they most wished for. 
 I slipped out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door quietly behind me. 
 "If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she frightens you, just call and I'll come in." 
 "No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid." 
 The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney- corner. 
 I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. 
 I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm. 
 She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one. 
 It looked all brown and black: elf- locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze. 
 "I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with. 
 You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you." 
 "Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely placed as you are." 
 If you knew it, you are peculiarly situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them. 
 "I don't understand enigmas. 
 "If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm." 
 "It is too fine," said she. "I can make nothing of such a hand as that; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? 
 "No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes, in the lines of the mouth. 
 She stirred the fire, so that a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined. 
 "Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself." 
 Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? 
 "I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it amuses me to watch them." 
 "Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage." 
 "The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator." 
 I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face." 
 "You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?" 
 "Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it), they will be a superlatively happy pair. 
 I knelt. 
 Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for its interlocutor. 
 "I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. 
 Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out'." 
 Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced. 
 In short, I believe you have been trying to draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense. 
 If, on reflection, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not right." 
 I knew gipsies and fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to conceal her features. 
 As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath. 
 "Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now." 
 Holding my hand in both his own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary look. 
 "Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that." 
 "I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with you." 
 "Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then leave me." "Yes, sir." 
 I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs. 
 The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall. 
 Indeed, whatever being uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie. 
 And overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered voice shouted-- 
 "Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:-- "Rochester! Rochester! for God's sake, come!" 
 A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery. 
 But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable. 
 "Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent. 
 "It's a mere rehearsal of Much Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous." 
 Now, then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after. 
 Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer." 
 When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what. 
 "I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no noise." 
 "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned the key and opened the door. 
 He made some sort of arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he came out and closed the door behind him. 
 Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason: I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in blood. 
 He took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. 
 He watched me a second, then saying, "Remember!--No conversation," he left the room. 
 I must watch this ghastly countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. 
 Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this that lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? 
 And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him? 
 I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him an apartment below--what brought him here! 
 His guest had been outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion! 
 Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of this. 
 He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him. 
 Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. 
 "Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the patient downstairs and all." 
 Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling. 
 "She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply. 
 "Not a whit!--courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all. 
 Carter, assure him there's no danger." 
 "Oh, it was frightful!" he added, shuddering. "And I did not expect it: she looked so quiet at first." 
 The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off." 
 "You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not think of her at all." 
 I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named, and returned with them. 
 "Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again." 
 I retired as directed. 
 "Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr. Rochester presently. 
 In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there." 
 "Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try." 
 Be of good cheer, Richard; step out--that's it!" 
 Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the chaise; Carter followed. 
 "Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye, Dick." 
 Now _here_" (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and pure." 
 "Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your thoughts." 
 "Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays." 
 "Never fear--I will take care of myself." 
 To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any day." "But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. 
 But I cannot give him orders in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible. 
 Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. 
 Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood before him. 
 You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?" 
 To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your judgment approves?" 
 The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate. 
 "Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should never depend on a fellow-creature. 
 I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for my cure in--" 
 "Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?" 
 "Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise: I rose at four to see him off." 
 Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension. 
 The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister. 
 "I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very badly at present--in great trouble." 
 His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. 
 Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was dead. 
 How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself." 
 She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. 
 "Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants' hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester. 
 To the billiard- room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game. 
 "But Reed left children?--you must have cousins? 
 "John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. 
 "I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it." 
 He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him. 
 He scowled at first; then, as if recollecting something, he said-- "Right, right! 
 Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. 
 "To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically? 
 "No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in asking favours of them--but I shall advertise." 
 "Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. 
 I should like something else: a little addition to the rite. 
 If one shook hands, for instance; but no--that would not content me either. 
 So you'll do no more than say Farewell, Jane?" 
 "It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many." 
 The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning. 
 I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. 
 Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you?" 
 The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. 
 The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished. 
 Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. 
 Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. 
 The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. 
 Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. 
 A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed. 
 "How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty. 
 The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow. 
 Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was unchanged and unchangeable. 
 My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source. 
 "You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on." 
 Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she was at once irritated. 
 It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. 
 Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. 
 In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature. 
 I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. 
 Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money? I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor. 
 I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off. 
 I can never submit to do that--yet how are we to get on? 
 Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. 
 John gambles dreadfully, and always loses--poor boy! He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him." 
 He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. 
 What is to be done? 
 Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister. 
 Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful working. 
 I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content. 
 She passed about five minutes each day in her mother's sick-room, and no more. 
 She had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task. 
 Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts. 
 "Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life. 
 Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? 
 Neglect it--go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be. 
 "You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade," answered Georgiana. 
 Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious. 
 Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition. 
 I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window. 
 The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: "One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements. 
 Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material tenement--flit when at length released?" 
 In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls. 
 "Who--I?" was her answer. "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. 
 You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!" 
 One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the other--" she stopped. 
 "After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her is painful." 
 Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there." 
 As I laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze. 
 I yet lingered half-an-hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. 
 Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared not go. 
 "With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble." 
 At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to stay another week. 
 When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you have some sense." 
 How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation. 
 Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came. 
 My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. 
 I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service. 
 Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person and character. 
 The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation. 
 "You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment. "I don't doubt it." 
 And then I strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear--and ran on. 
 They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. 
 I have but a field or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates. 
 I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr. 
 Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing. 
 I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not make an absolute fool of myself. 
 If I dared, I'd touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh. 
 Truant! truant!" he added, when he had paused an instant. "Absent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!" 
 "You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. 
 Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going on for such an event. 
 Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him. 
 If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay. 
 Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar. 
 I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me. 
 I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel? 
 It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful embarrassment. 
 I asked. "Must I leave Thornfield?" 
 "Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes." 
 "Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--" "Oh, no need to apologise! 
 You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say." 
 "No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance." 
 "Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--" 
 He seated me and himself. 
 "It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped? 
 "I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least. 
 Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!--I have as much soul as you,--and full as much heart! 
 "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you." 
 "Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too." 
 The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept. 
 "Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another." 
 "I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return." 
 If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture." 
 "Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? 
 "Then, sir, I will marry you." 
 "Edward--my little wife!" 
 "God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I have her, and will hold her." 
 After which he murmured, "It will atone--it will atone. 
 Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? 
 The moon was not yet set, and we were all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was. 
 "Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good- night--good-night, my darling!" 
 "Explanation will do for another time," thought I. Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen. 
 As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it were a dream. 
 While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. 
 I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. 
 During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her then. 
 "Where are you going? 
 It is time for lessons." "Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery." 
 It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him. 
 This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?" 
 Do you hear that?" 
 I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. 
 "Oh, sir!--never rain jewels! 
 "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. 
 I think I shall like you again, and yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_ you--with truth, fervour, constancy." 
 Jane, you please me, and you master me--you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart. 
 "Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--" 
 "Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain pocket handkerchief you have there." 
 "Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much piqued on one point." 
 Do you think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? 
 I would much rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?" 
 Your eyebrows have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled thunderloft.' 
 "If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. 
 "I think I may confess," he continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. 
 "Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling. 
 "Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a moment." 
 The old lady, had been reading her morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open before her, and her spectacles were upon it. 
 She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table. 
 Sometimes I half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened. 
 She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma. 
 I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of his. 
 "Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough that all was right." 
 The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him backwards and forwards. 
 I was about mechanically to obey him, without further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at my face. 
 "What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone. 
 Do you really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?" 
 "After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and company--for life." 
 She then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information. 
 "She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time: "besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. 
 I said I should like to go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings to fly. 
 "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?" he exclaimed. 
 "I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest. 
 You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?" 
 "I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now: till--" 
 "I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as usual for another month." 
 "Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with it as usual. 
 I had prepared an occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a _tete-a-tete_ conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked to sing--good singers generally do. 
 Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he could play as well as sing. 
 "The truest love that ever heart Felt at its kindled core, Did through each vein, in quickened start, The tide of being pour. 
 I dreamed it would be nameless bliss, As I loved, loved to be; And to this object did I press As blind as eagerly. 
 I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned; I omens did defy: Whatever menaced, harassed, warned, I passed impetuous by. 
 On sped my rainbow, fast as light; I flew as in a dream; For glorious rose upon my sight That child of Shower and Gleam. 
 Still bright on clouds of suffering dim Shines that soft, solemn joy; Nor care I now, how dense and grim Disasters gather nigh. 
 I care not in this moment sweet, Though all I have rushed o'er Should come on pinion, strong and fleet, Proclaiming vengeance sore: 
 Though haughty Hate should strike me down, Right, bar approach to me, And grinding Might, with furious frown, Swear endless enmity. 
 My love has placed her little hand With noble faith in mine, And vowed that wedlock's sacred band Our nature shall entwine. 
 My love has sworn, with sealing kiss, With me to live--to die; I have at last my nameless bliss. As I love--loved am I!" 
 I quailed momentarily--then I rallied. 
 Soft scene, daring demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity, "whom he was going to marry now?" 
 I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his future wife dying with him. 
 What did he mean by such a pagan idea? _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that." 
 Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas crooned in her praise." 
 Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well. 
 Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. 
 It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. 
 Mr. Rochester that night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to his meditated departure from England. 
 I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline. 
 He saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his hat off, and waved it round his head. 
 "I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not: my prize is not certain. 
 I found him at supper. 
 "Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me." 
 "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it close to my eyes. 
 "Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before my wedding." 
 "Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core." 
 On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. 
 I think because you said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is too much as if some spirit were near me. 
 I warn you of incredulity beforehand. 
 Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere, however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress, I must retain it. 
 I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment. 
 There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. 
 I know not what dress she had on: it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell." 
 "Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! 
 It was a discoloured face--it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!" 
 "Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and flinging both on the floor, trampled on them." 
 I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible from terror." 
 Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that." 
 You call her a strange being yourself: from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me? what to Mason? 
 I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented smile. 
 And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him. 
 "And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you. 
 Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the curtain)--"it is a lovely night!" 
 The moon shone peacefully. 
 "And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy love and blissful union." 
 "Stop!" she cried in French. "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have not taken one peep." 
 So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. 
 "Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there: return and tell me." 
 I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame. 
 By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips cold. 
 Hearing a cautious step behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman, evidently--was advancing up the chancel. 
 "The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us. "I am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this marriage exists." 
 Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. 
 "What is the nature of the impediment?" he asked. "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?" 
 His whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. 
 He disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. 
 "I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law recognises, if you do not." 
 "Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her place of abode." 
 "That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living." 
 "Produce him--or go to hell." 
 The second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason himself. 
 Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he only asked--"What have _you_ to say?" 
 I again demand, what have you to say?" 
 Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?" 
 "Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out." 
 Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last. 
 Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. 
 Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd almost as soon strike a woman as you. 
 I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. 
 Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came after. 
 Not I!--they are fifteen years too late!" 
 "You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you here." 
 He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this, too, he opened. 
 Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a saucepan. 
 "Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!" 
 The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and gazed wildly at her visitors. 
 Mrs. Poole advanced. "Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard." 
 "One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in mortal discretion to fathom her craft." 
 She was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she almost throttled him, athletic as he was. 
 The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. 
 "You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason returns to Madeira." 
 Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. 
 He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. 
 I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change: nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. 
 I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive. 
 Real affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. 
 I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast. 
 I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up--I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold. 
 "You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness than of will. 
 "Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me." 
 He put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon myself. 
 I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave him." "How are you now, Jane?" 
 "Much better, sir; I shall be well soon." 
 I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess rightly?" 
 "Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice warned me to curtail my sentence. 
 Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted. 
 "Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was. 
 I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from falsehood and slander." 
 I told you I would send Adele to school; and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a French dancer's bastard? 
 "Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence." 
 I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him. 
 I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me. 
 Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then? 
 It was only my station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I were some toad or ape." 
 These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? 
 As to the new existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married. 
 You shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the Mediterranean. 
 Out of pity to me and yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!" 
 "Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland. 
 Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. 
 Her family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed. 
 Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste. 
 I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me. 
 "No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you." 
 But that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine. 
 I accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent--my arms wait to receive her." 
 In the eyes of the world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects. 
 When I think of the thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--" 
 My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--" 
 Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeserved. 
 I tried dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate. 
 That was my Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure. 
 Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it. 
 "Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?' 
 "When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap and sense--stole into my frame. 
 Adele claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time. 
 Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. 
 I made you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts. 
 I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out. "I resumed my notice of you. 
 To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a hideous demon. 
 I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. 
 I feared early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences. 
 A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he forebore yet. 
 Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone. 
 Hope to meet again there." 
 "Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back on lust for a passion--vice for an occupation?" 
 I declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. 
 They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly. 
 I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad--as I am now. 
 Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. 
 He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety. 
 The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in the eye. 
 "Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable. 
 (And he shook me with the force of his hold.) 
 "I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her? 
 And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame. 
 I had dared and baffled his fury; I must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door. 
 "Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish. 
 "God bless you, my dear master!" I said. 
 "God keep you from harm and wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to me." 
 "Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered; "without it, my heart is broken. 
 But Jane will give me her love: yes--nobly, generously." 
 "It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes. 
 That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience for day. 
 He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone. 
 I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down. 
 The first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy. 
 I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement. 
 It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in. 
 It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. 
 Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. 
 Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. 
 Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me. 
 I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch. 
 Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear. 
 Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God. 
 Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high. 
 With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. 
 I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. 
 I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try. 
 I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it. 
 I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend, without a coin. 
 "Some does one thing, and some another. Poor folk mun get on as they can." 
 "I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want some work: no matter what." 
 Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. 
 She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i' that way." 
 "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said. 
 I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. 
 I imagine he did not think I was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it. 
 But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation--this total prostration of hope. 
 Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. 
 My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. 
 The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. 
 Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties. 
 Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. 
 I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. 
 A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. 
 I cannot call them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. 
 "Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon." 
 "He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. 
 One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. 
 Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me. 
 "Tell the young ladies. Let me see them--" 
 Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted it within. 
 "I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God. 
 There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone yet!--laid down there. 
 Presently I stood within that clean, bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. 
 Ere long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. 
 The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. 
 I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. 
 To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me. 
 He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to herself. 
 He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while. 
 When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. 
 After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. 
 She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it." 
 And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are." 
 When he is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton." 
 She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends. 
 Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found. 
 And still holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room. 
 I examined first, the parlour, and then its occupant. 
 A few strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. 
 Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed--was easy enough to examine. 
 Yet he whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. 
 The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three. 
 Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature. 
 I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort. 
 I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit. 
 Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly. 
 I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less. 
 I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. 
 I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his toil brings--the higher the honour. 
 The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations. 
 "I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week." 
 "I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life." 
 My father and he quarrelled long ago. 
 Not to deceive myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree. 
 But let me not hate and despise myself too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained; I shall strive to overcome them. 
 I shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms. 
 Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village. 
 While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping--and why? 
 He examined my face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon it. 
 "But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have disappointed your expectations? 
 They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--" I interrupted-- 
 "It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience. 
 From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal. 
 Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty. 
 I naturally asked myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. 
 "Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like. 
 "Good evening!" he repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo. 
 I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I could. 
 There was a difference amongst them as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference rapidly developed itself. 
 Their amazement at me, my language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. 
 Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance. 
 I was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a _lusus naturae_, she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance. 
 She had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls. 
 No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness. 
 "With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. 
 "It is like!" he murmured; "the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. 
 "As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take to yourself the original at once." 
 "It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another quarter of an hour." And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon the table to measure the time. 
 Hush! say nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the time I marked pass in peace." 
 Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth. 
 "No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated. 
 I am simply, in my original state--stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a cold, hard, ambitious man. 
 Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. 
 Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my original qualities thus: 
 No." He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. 
 "Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. 
 I pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it. 
 "I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me." 
 Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips. 
 Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in- law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. 
 "I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end. 
 "Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester? 
 One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow. 
 It was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt that--that thought swelled my heart. 
 "You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers. "I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. 
 This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had never heard laugh before, laughed now. 
 I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred. 
 Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so. 
 "Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. 
 I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability. 
 Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every ring was perfect, the connection complete. 
 A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out. 
 I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough. 
 This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections. 
 I now clapped my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled. 
 I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight. 
 Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit. 
 Now the wealth did not weigh on me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment. 
 He also advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again. 
 It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though it might in law. 
 "Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the case?" 
 I never had a home, I never had brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?" 
 "Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights." 
 "But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry." 
 Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely." 
 I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and admiration of their talents. 
 I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. 
 I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly. 
 And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls. 
 I must enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday." 
 "Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning." 
 He took it. 
 "It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys." 
 "The best things the world has!" 
 I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to stir me up to restlessness! 
 Don't cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. 
 Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to advantage. 
 They laughed--kissed me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened into the house. 
 They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight. 
 They both threw their arms round his neck at once. 
 I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me. 
 The event of the day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. 
 St. John had a book in his hand--it was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up. 
 "But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?" 
 "I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called upon to contend for such another. 
 One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a cold. 
 By degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference. 
 When he said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it. 
 Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed-- 
 He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. 
 Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing it. 
 He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced-- 
 I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect. 
 It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love. 
 You shall be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's service." 
 I know my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. 
 My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step. 
 Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. 
 In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me? 
 If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature death. 
 And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? 
 That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations. 
 If I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire victim. 
 Unmarried to him, this would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice his plans--go through the wedding ceremony? 
 Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? 
 He started to his feet and approached me. 
 You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have undertaken can best be done. 
 To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that is a loose tie--but a husband. 
 I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death." 
 I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on my limbs. 
 "And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. 
 Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. 
 I was with an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist. 
 I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness. 
 "I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you." 
 How can we be for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes--and unwed?" 
 And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and--it would not do." 
 If the reality were required, what should we do? 
 Turning from me, he once more "Looked to river, looked to hill." 
 I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the stairs. 
 I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once. 
 "Now you will indeed hate me," I said. "It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you." 
 "You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not." 
 With me, then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor. 
 "It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a castaway. 
 Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face. 
 St. John is a strange being--" She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed-- 
 "That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he never showed to any one else--to what end? 
 I wish he loved you--does he, Jane?" 
 "He does--he has asked me to be his wife." 
 "Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils." 
 "Madness!" she exclaimed. "You would not live three months there, I am certain. 
 "I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency. 
 I had thought he would hardly speak to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. 
 He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary manner--one scrupulously polite. 
 But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." 
 In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest. 
 He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. 
 He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. 
 Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. 
 Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey. 
 To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. 
 "I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now--come afterwards what would!" 
 I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. "Show me, show me the path!" 
 I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down, unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight. 
 He stopped at my door: I feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door. 
 I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent. 
 I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external world. 
 I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate. 
 It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! 
 Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home. 
 "Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields." 
 You have lost your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor. 
 At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness. 
 Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. 
 What then? Who would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me? 
 I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls. 
 He steals softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen. 
 How he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his finger! 
 No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! 
 No need to listen for doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! 
 The front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in. 
 I requested him to shut the door and sit down: I had some questions to ask him. 
 I gasped. "Is he dead?" 
 Fully assured by these words that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman." 
 It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity. 
 He would be alone, too. 
 He sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she deserved it--she was a very good woman. 
 He would not cross the door-stones of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am. 
 She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood. 
 We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the pavement." 
 "You said he was alive?" I exclaimed. 
 My blood was again running cold. "Where is he?" 
 He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple." 
 I looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere. 
 I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. 
 It was a sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. 
 His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. 
 A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. 
 To her hurried "Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?" 
 I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire. 
 This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room. 
 Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_ nothing, he returned and sighed. 
 I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me, still excited. 
 If so there must be more of her." 
 The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him. 
 "My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am come back to you." 
 These are certainly her limbs, and these her features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. 
 But I always woke and found it an empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely, hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and never to be fed. 
 "There, sir--and there!"' 
 You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles' feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have not yet noticed." 
 Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to your judgment. 
 My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time after. 
 "Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your life: quite more refined and exalted." 
 "You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred! 
 I thought with glee. "I see I have the means of fretting him out of his melancholy for some time to come." 
 His countenance reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another for that office! 
 I had meant to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity I could. 
 I had wakened the glow: his features beamed. 
 I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun had rays. 
 What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? 
 "Damn him!"--(To me.) "Did you like him, Jane?" 
 "Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so truthful. 
 He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?" 
 But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love you, you would be proud and content. 
 "You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and vigorous. 
 "Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. 
 Jane. But I want a wife." 
 "That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice." 
 "Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more. 
 "I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed for thee, Janet! 
 Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh! 
 "Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point. 
 You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!" 
 I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!" 
 Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide. 
 A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away. 
 And again, "If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that." 
 He has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things. 
 I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband needed them all. 
 So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes. 
 I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. 
 He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes. 
 The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. 
 Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 
 There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' 
 But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? 
 Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. 
 There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. 
 I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. 
 However, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. 
 First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. 
 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!' 
 I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! 
 And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! 
 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! 
 It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' 
 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! 
 I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-- 
 As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. 
 'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' 
 The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. 
 And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. 
 The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! 
 They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. 
 William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke. 
 This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. 
 Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered. 
 'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. 
 I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. 
 Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? 
 'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' 
 There was no label this time with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. 'I know something interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does. 
 She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. 
 When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! 
 Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!' 
 She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. 
 And then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!' 
 'I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! 
 There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. 
 'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,' Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? 
 Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.' 
 However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. 
 'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! 
 She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. 
 And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. 
 'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!' 
 'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning. 
 'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! 
 How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! 
 However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how is that to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 
 She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. 
 'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.' 
 She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:-- 
 Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. 
 'Which would not be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! 
 The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. 
 The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the best butter, you know.' 
 'What a funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' 
 'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' 
 'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk about wasting it. It's him.' 
 'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' 
 'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--' 
 The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, 'It was a treacle-well.' 
 'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?' 
 'But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' 
 Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!' 
 'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my elbow.' 
 Two began in a low voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. 
 'You make me giddy.' And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What have you been doing here?' 
 'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.' 
 'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!' 
 The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. 
 The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. 
 'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked. 
 'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried. 
 'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! 
 'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!' 
 Alice asked. 'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really you are very dull!' 
 Never heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?' 
 Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?' 
 'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. 
 -- '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail. 
 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance? 
 '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied. "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side. 
 The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. 
 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"' 
 'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon. 
 'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. 
 'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.' 
 'Why?''It does the boots and shoes.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly. 
 Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in a wondering tone. 
 'Why, what are your shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what makes them so shiny?' 
 Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.' 
 'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, 'are done with a whiting. Now you know.' 
 'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we don't want you with us!"' 
 'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"' 
 'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of your adventures.' 
 She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. 
 'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:-- 
 'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' 
 She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done just as well. 
 Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.' 
 'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!' 
 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--' 
 Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name 'Alice!' 
 'I'm not a mile high,' said Alice. 
 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.) 
 'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than that. 
 He listened with all his ears, as attentive as if at a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean on his elbow; and when at two o'clock the bell rang, the master was obliged to tell him to fall into line with the rest of us. 
 But, whether he had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to attempt it, the "new fellow," was still holding his cap on his knees even after prayers were over. 
 The whole class began to laugh. 
 There was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly put the poor lad out of countenance that he did not know whether to keep his cap in his hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on his head. 
 He got up, but before going hesitated. 
 Thanks, no doubt, to the willingness he showed, he had not to go down to the class below. But though he knew his rules passably, he had little finish in composition. 
 His wife had adored him once on a time; she had bored him with a thousand servilities that had only estranged him the more. 
 As opposed to the maternal ideas, he had a certain virile idea of childhood on which he sought to mould his son, wishing him to be brought up hardily, like a Spartan, to give him a strong constitution. 
 But, peaceable by nature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions. 
 His mother always kept him near her; she cut out cardboard for him, told him tales, entertained him with endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety and charming nonsense. 
 In her life's isolation she centered on the child's head all her shattered, broken little vanities. 
 But to all this Monsieur Bovary, caring little for letters, said, "It was not worth while. 
 Besides, with cheek a man always gets on in the world." 
 They were given at spare moments in the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between a baptism and a burial; or else the cure, if he had not to go out, sent for his pupil after the Angelus*. 
 They went up to his room and settled down; the flies and moths fluttered round the candle. 
 It was close, the child fell asleep, and the good man, beginning to doze with his hands on his stomach, was soon snoring with his mouth wide open. 
 The rain interrupted them or an acquaintance passed. 
 Six months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to school at Rouen, where his father took him towards the end of October, at the time of the St. Romain fair. 
 Then at the end of a week she departed, after a thousand injunctions to be good now that he was going to be left to himself. 
 To spare him expense his mother sent him every week by the carrier a piece of veal baked in the oven, with which he lunched when he came back from the hospital, while he sat kicking his feet against the wall. 
 On the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close streets are empty, when the servants are playing shuttle-cock at the doors, he opened his window and leaned out. 
 Once he missed a lecture; the next day all the lectures; and, enjoying his idleness, little by little, he gave up work altogether. 
 To shut himself up every evening in the dirty public room, to push about on marble tables the small sheep bones with black dots, seemed to him a fine proof of his freedom, which raised him in his own esteem. 
 It was beginning to see life, the sweetness of stolen pleasures; and when he entered, he put his hand on the door-handle with a joy almost sensual. 
 Then many things hidden within him came out; he learnt couplets by heart and sang them to his boon companions, became enthusiastic about Beranger, learnt how to make punch, and, finally, how to make love. 
 He started on foot, stopped at the beginning of the village, sent for his mother, and told her all. 
 So Charles set to work again and crammed for his examination, ceaselessly learning all the old questions by heart. 
 He passed pretty well. 
 To attain her ends Madame Bovary had to oust them all, and she even succeeded in very cleverly baffling the intrigues of a port-butcher backed up by the priests. 
 The noise of footsteps made her ill; when people left her, solitude became odious to her; if they came back, it was doubtless to see her die. 
 When Charles returned in the evening, she stretched forth two long thin arms from beneath the sheets, put them round his neck, and having made him sit down on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he was neglecting her, he loved another. 
 She had been warned she would be unhappy; and she ended by asking him for a dose of medicine and a little more love. 
 Still sleepy from the warmth of his bed, he let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his horse. 
 The rain had stopped, day was breaking, and on the branches of the leafless trees birds roosted motionless, their little feathers bristling in the cold morning wind. 
 As he passed Vassonville he came upon a boy sitting on the grass at the edge of a ditch. 
 "Are you the doctor?" asked the child. 
 And on Charles's answer he took his wooden shoes in his hands and ran on in front of him. 
 The general practitioner, riding along, gathered from his guide's talk that Monsieur Rouault must be one of the well-to-do farmers. 
 The horse slipped on the wet grass; Charles had to stoop to pass under the branches. 
 As he entered the Bertaux, the horse took fright and stumbled. 
 Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from which manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six peacocks, a luxury in Chauchois farmyards, were foraging on the top of it. 
 Charles went up the first floor to see the patient. 
 He was a fat little man of fifty, with white skin and blue eyes, the forepart of his head bald, and he wore earrings. 
 By his side on a chair stood a large decanter of brandy, whence he poured himself a little from time to time to keep up his spirits; but as soon as he caught sight of the doctor his elation subsided, and instead of swearing, as he had been doing for the last twelve hours, began to groan freely. 
 Charles selected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment of windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew some pads. 
 As she was a long time before she found her work-case, her father grew impatient; she did not answer, but as she sewed she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her mouth to suck them. 
 Charles went down into the room on the ground floor. 
 Knives and forks and silver goblets were laid for two on a little table at the foot of a huge bed that had a canopy of printed cotton with figures representing Turks. 
 By way of decoration for the apartment, hanging to a nail in the middle of the wall, whose green paint scaled off from the effects of the saltpetre, was a crayon head of Minerva in gold frame, underneath which was written in Gothic letters "To dear Papa." 
 This showed something of her full lips, that she had a habit of biting when silent. 
 When Charles, after bidding farewell to old Rouault, returned to the room before leaving, he found her standing, her forehead against the window, looking into the garden, where the bean props had been knocked down by the wind. 
 She turned round. 
 Charles out of politeness made a dash also, and as he stretched out his arm, at the same moment felt his breast brush against the back of the young girl bending beneath him. 
 During the first period of Charles's visits to the Bertaux, Madame Bovary junior never failed to inquire after the invalid, and she had even chosen in the book that she kept on a system of double entry a clean blank page for Monsieur Rouault. 
 That was the last straw. 
 "So it is for this," she said to herself, "that his face beams when he goes to see her, and that he puts on his new waistcoat at the risk of spoiling it with the rain. Ah! that woman! 
 And she detested her instinctively. 
 At first she solaced herself by allusions that Charles did not understand, then by casual observations that he let pass for fear of a storm, finally by open apostrophes to which he knew not what to answer. 
 "Why did he go back to the Bertaux now that Monsieur Rouault was cured and that these folks hadn't paid yet? 
 "The daughter of old Rouault a town miss! 
 Why did he always offer a glass of something to everyone who came? What obstinacy not to wear flannels! 
 In the spring it came about that a notary at Ingouville, the holder of the widow Dubuc's property, one fine day went off, taking with him all the money in his office. 
 Heloise, it is true, still possessed, besides a share in a boat valued at six thousand francs, her house in the Rue St. Francois; and yet, with all this fortune that had been so trumpeted abroad, nothing, excepting perhaps a little furniture and a few clothes, had appeared in the household. 
 A week after, as she was hanging up some washing in her yard, she was seized with a spitting of blood, and the next day, while Charles had his back turned to her drawing the window-curtain, she said, "O God!" gave a sigh and fainted. She was dead! 
 When all was over at the cemetery Charles went home. He found no one downstairs; he went up to the first floor to their room; say her dress still hanging at the foot of the alcove; then, leaning against the writing-table, he stayed until the evening, buried in a sorrowful reverie. 
 He went back to the Bertaux. He found all as he had left it, that is to say, as it was five months ago. 
 He could now change his meal-times, go in or out without explanation, and when he was very tired stretch himself at full length on his bed. 
 So he nursed and coddled himself and accepted the consolations that were offered him. 
 On the other hand, the death of his wife had not served him ill in his business, since for a month people had been saying, "The poor young man! what a loss!" 
 His name had been talked about, his practice had increased; and moreover, he could go to the Bertaux just as he liked. 
 He went into the kitchen, but did not at once catch sight of Emma; the outside shutters were closed. 
 Some flies on the table were crawling up the glasses that had been used, and buzzing as they drowned themselves in the dregs of the cider. 
 The daylight that came in by the chimney made velvet of the soot at the back of the fireplace, and touched with blue the cold cinders. 
 The air coming in under the door blew a little dust over the flags; he watched it drift along, and heard nothing but the throbbing in his head and the faint clucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the yard. 
 She showed him her old music-books, the little prizes she had won, and the oak-leaf crowns, left at the bottom of a cupboard. 
 She spoke to him, too, of her mother, of the country, and even showed him the bed in the garden where, on the first Friday of every month, she gathered flowers to put on her mother's tomb. 
 Going home at night, Charles went over her words one by one, trying to recall them, to fill out their sense, that he might piece out the life she had lived before he knew her. 
 But he never saw her in his thoughts other than he had seen her the first time, or as he had just left her. Then he asked himself what would become of her—if she would be married, and to whom! 
 The night was covered with stars, a warm wind blowing in the distance; the dogs were barking. He turned his head towards the Bertaux. 
 Old Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter, who was of no use to him in the house. 
 He liked old cider, underdone legs of mutton, glorias* well beaten up. 
 Charles fastened his horse to a tree; he ran into the road and waited. 
 The discussion of money matters was put off; moreover, there was plenty of time before them, as the marriage could not decently take place till Charles was out of mourning, that is to say, about the spring of the next year. 
 Emma would, on the contrary, have preferred to have a midnight wedding with torches, but old Rouault could not understand such an idea. 
 So there was a wedding at which forty-three persons were present, at which they remained sixteen hours at table, began again the next day, and to some extent on the days following. 
 They got down from all sides, rubbing knees and stretching arms. 
 As there were not enough stable-boys to unharness all the carriages, the gentlemen turned up their sleeves and set about it themselves. 
 And the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses! 
 The procession, first united like one long coloured scarf that undulated across the fields, along the narrow path winding amid the green corn, soon lengthened out, and broke up into different groups that loitered to talk. 
 Emma's dress, too long, trailed a little on the ground; from time to time she stopped to pull it up, and then delicately, with her gloved hands, she picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns, while Charles, empty handed, waited till she had finished. 
 The other wedding guests talked of their business or played tricks behind each other's backs, egging one another on in advance to be jolly. 
 The noise of the instrument drove away the little birds from afar. 
 At the corners were decanters of brandy. Sweet bottled-cider frothed round the corks, and all the glasses had been filled to the brim with wine beforehand. 
 Large dishes of yellow cream, that trembled with the least shake of the table, had designed on their smooth surface the initials of the newly wedded pair in nonpareil arabesques. 
 A confectioner of Yvetot had been intrusted with the tarts and sweets. 
 As he had only just set up on the place, he had taken a lot of trouble, and at dessert he himself brought in a set dish that evoked loud cries of wonderment. 
 At night when they left, the horses, stuffed up to the nostrils with oats, could hardly be got into the shafts; they kicked, reared, the harness broke, their masters laughed or swore; and all night in the light of the moon along country roads there were runaway carts at full gallop plunging into the ditches, jumping over yard after yard of stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning out from the tilt to catch hold of the reins. 
 However, a fishmonger, one of their cousins (who had even brought a pair of soles for his wedding present), began to squirt water from his mouth through the keyhole, when old Rouault came up just in time to stop him, and explain to him that the distinguished position of his son-in-law would not allow of such liberties. 
 The cousin all the same did not give in to these reasons readily. 
 In his heart he accused old Rouault of being proud, and he joined four or five other guests in a corner, who having, through mere chance, been several times running served with the worst helps of meat, also were of opinion they had been badly used, and were whispering about their host, and with covered hints hoping he would ruin himself. 
 He answered feebly to the puns, doubles entendres*, compliments, and chaff that it was felt a duty to let off at him as soon as the soup appeared. 
 Two days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on account of his patients, could not be away longer. 
 Old Rouault had them driven back in his cart, and himself accompanied them as far as Vassonville. Here he embraced his daughter for the last time, got down, and went his way. 
 When he had gone about a hundred paces he stopped, and as he saw the cart disappearing, its wheels turning in the dust, he gave a deep sigh. Then he remembered his wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of his wife; he, too, had been very happy the day when he had taken her from her father to his home, and had carried her off on a pillion, trotting through the snow, for it was near Christmas-time, and the country was all white. 
 She held him by one arm, her basket hanging from the other; the wind blew the long lace of her Cauchois headdress so that it sometimes flapped across his mouth, and when he turned his head he saw near him, on his shoulder, her little rosy face, smiling silently under the gold bands of her cap. To warm her hands she put them from time to time in his breast. 
 He felt dreary as an empty house; and tender memories mingling with the sad thoughts in his brain, addled by the fumes of the feast, he felt inclined for a moment to take a turn towards the church. As he was afraid, however, that this sight would make him yet more sad, he went right away home. 
 The old servant presented herself, curtsied to her, apologised for not having dinner ready, and suggested that madame, in the meantime, should look over her house. 
 On the right was the one apartment, that was both dining and sitting room. 
 A canary yellow paper, relieved at the top by a garland of pale flowers, was puckered everywhere over the badly stretched canvas; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways at the length of the window; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with a head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate candlesticks under oval shades. 
 On the other side of the passage was Charles's consulting room, a little room about six paces wide, with a table, three chairs, and an office chair. 
 Volumes of the "Dictionary of Medical Science," uncut, but the binding rather the worse for the successive sales through which they had gone, occupied almost along the six shelves of a deal bookcase. 
 The garden, longer than wide, ran between two mud walls with espaliered apricots, to a hawthorn hedge that separated it from the field. 
 A shell box adorned the chest of drawers, and on the secretary near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin ribbons stood in a bottle. 
 It was a bride's bouquet; it was the other one's. 
 She looked at it. 
 Charles noticed it; he took it and carried it up to the attic, while Emma seated in an arm-chair (they were putting her things down around her) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if she were to die. 
 His own eyes lost themselves in these depths; he saw himself in miniature down to the shoulders, with his handkerchief round his head and the top of his shirt open. 
 Later on, when he studied medicine, and never had his purse full enough to treat some little work-girl who would have become his mistress? 
 Afterwards, he had lived fourteen months with the widow, whose feet in bed were cold as icicles. 
 And Emma tried to find out what one meant exactly in life by the words felicity, passion, rapture, that had seemed to her so beautiful in books. 
 The explanatory legends, chipped here and there by the scratching of knives, all glorified religion, the tendernesses of the heart, and the pomps of court. 
 She played very little during recreation hours, knew her catechism well, and it was she who always answered Monsieur le Vicaire's difficult questions. 
 She puzzled her head to find some vow to fulfil. 
 The comparisons of betrothed, husband, celestial lover, and eternal marriage, that recur in sermons, stirred within her soul depths of unexpected sweetness. 
 If her childhood had been spent in the shop-parlour of some business quarter, she might perhaps have opened her heart to those lyrical invasions of Nature, which usually come to us only through translation in books. 
 She had a funeral picture made with the hair of the deceased, and, in a letter sent to the Bertaux full of sad reflections on life, she asked to be buried later on in the same grave. The goodman thought she must be ill, and came to see her. 
 Emma was secretly pleased that she had reached at a first attempt the rare ideal of pale lives, never attained by mediocre hearts. 
 To taste the full sweetness of it, it would have been necessary doubtless to fly to those lands with sonorous names where the days after marriage are full of laziness most suave. 
 Why could not she lean over balconies in Swiss chalets, or enshrine her melancholy in a Scotch cottage, with a husband dressed in a black velvet coat with long tails, and thin shoes, a pointed hat and frills? Perhaps she would have liked to confide all these things to someone. 
 But how tell an undefinable uneasiness, variable as the clouds, unstable as the winds? Words failed her—the opportunity, the courage. 
 He could neither swim, nor fence, nor shoot, and one day he could not explain some term of horsemanship to her that she had come across in a novel. 
 She struck the notes with aplomb, and ran from top to bottom of the keyboard without a break. 
 Thus shaken up, the old instrument, whose strings buzzed, could be heard at the other end of the village when the window was open, and often the bailiff's clerk, passing along the highroad bare-headed and in list slippers, stopped to listen, his sheet of paper in his hand. 
 As he had been for a time accustomed to wear nightcaps, his handkerchief would not keep down over his ears, so that his hair in the morning was all tumbled pell-mell about his face and whitened with the feathers of the pillow, whose strings came untied during the night. 
 He always wore thick boots that had two long creases over the instep running obliquely towards the ankle, while the rest of the upper continued in a straight line as if stretched on a wooden foot. He said that "was quite good enough for the country." 
 His mother approved of his economy, for she came to see him as formerly when there had been some violent row at her place; and yet Madame Bovary senior seemed prejudiced against her daughter-in-law. 
 Emma put up with these lessons. 
 She recalled to him as remembrances her troubles and her sacrifices, and, comparing these with Emma's negligence, came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable to adore her so exclusively. 
 Charles knew not what to answer: he respected his mother, and he loved his wife infinitely; he considered the judgment of the one infallible, and yet he thought the conduct of the other irreproachable. 
 When she had thus for a while struck the flint on her heart without getting a spark, incapable, moreover, of understanding what she did not experience as of believing anything that did not present itself in conventional forms, she persuaded herself without difficulty that Charles's passion was nothing very exorbitant. 
 His outbursts became regular; he embraced her at certain fixed times. 
 It was one habit among other habits, and, like a dessert, looked forward to after the monotony of dinner. 
 A gamekeeper, cured by the doctor of inflammation of the lungs, had given madame a little Italian greyhound; she took her out walking, for she went out sometimes in order to be alone for a moment, and not to see before her eyes the eternal garden and the dusty road. 
 She went as far as the beeches of Banneville, near the deserted pavilion which forms an angle of the wall on the side of the country. Amidst the vegetation of the ditch there are long reeds with leaves that cut you. 
 She began by looking round her to see if nothing had changed since last she had been there. 
 She found again in the same places the foxgloves and wallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round the big stones, and the patches of lichen along the three windows, whose shutters, always closed, were rotting away on their rusty iron bars. 
 But she—her life was cold as a garret whose dormer window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider, was weaving its web in the darkness in every corner of her heart. 
 How far all of this! 
 How far away! 
 A fear took hold of her; she called Djali, and hurriedly returned to Tostes by the high road, threw herself into an armchair, and for the rest of the evening did not speak. 
 During the dog-days he had suffered from an abscess, which Charles had cured as if by miracle by giving a timely little touch with the lancet. 
 On the dark wainscoting of the walls large gold frames bore at the bottom names written in black letters. She read: "Jean-Antoine d'Andervilliers d'Yvervonbille, Count de la Vaubyessard and Baron de la Fresnay, killed at the battle of Coutras on the 20th of October, 1587." 
 She made her sit down by her on an ottoman, and began talking to her as amicably as if she had known her a long time. 
 She was a woman of about forty, with fine shoulders, a hook nose, a drawling voice, and on this evening she wore over her brown hair a simple guipure fichu that fell in a point at the back. 
 His eyes were bloodshot, and he wore a little queue tied with black ribbon. 
 She did her hair according to the directions of the hairdresser, and put on the barege dress spread out upon the bed. Charles's trousers were tight across the belly. 
 "My trouser-straps will be rather awkward for dancing," he said. 
 One could hear the flourish of the violin and the notes of a horn. 
 One complained that his racehorses were growing fat; another of the printers' errors that had disfigured the name of his horse. 
 A servant got upon a chair and broke the window-panes. 
 At the crash of the glass Madame Bovary turned her head and saw in the garden the faces of peasants pressed against the window looking in at them. 
 But in the refulgence of the present hour her past life, so distinct until then, faded away completely, and she almost doubted having lived it. She was there; beyond the ball was only shadow overspreading all the rest. 
 She was just eating a maraschino ice that she held with her left hand in a silver-gilt cup, her eyes half-closed, and the spoon between her teeth. 
 A lady near her dropped her fan. 
 A gentlemen was passing. 
 After supper, where were plenty of Spanish and Rhine wines, soups a la bisque and au lait d'amandes*, puddings a la Trafalgar, and all sorts of cold meats with jellies that trembled in the dishes, the carriages one after the other began to drive off. 
 The seats began to empty, some card-players were still left; the musicians were cooling the tips of their fingers on their tongues. 
 They turned; all around them was turning—the lamps, the furniture, the wainscoting, the floor, like a disc on a pivot. 
 When she opened them again, in the middle of the drawing room three waltzers were kneeling before a lady sitting on a stool. 
 The night was dark; some drops of rain were falling. 
 And she tried to keep herself awake in order to prolong the illusion of this luxurious life that she would soon have to give up. 
 She looked long at the windows of the chateau, trying to guess which were the rooms of all those she had noticed the evening before. She would fain have known their lives, have penetrated, blended with them. 
 Next, Mademoiselle d'Andervilliers collected some pieces of roll in a small basket to take them to the swans on the ornamental waters, and they went to walk in the hot-houses, where strange plants, bristling with hairs, rose in pyramids under hanging vases, whence, as from over-filled nests of serpents, fell long green cords interlacing. 
 The orangery, which was at the other end, led by a covered way to the outhouses of the chateau. 
 Charles, meanwhile, went to ask a groom to put his horse to. The dog-cart was brought to the foot of the steps, and, all the parcels being crammed in, the Bovarys paid their respects to the Marquis and Marchioness and set out again for Tostes. 
 Emma watched the turning wheels in silence. 
 Charles, on the extreme edge of the seat, held the reins with his two arms wide apart, and the little horse ambled along in the shafts that were too big for him. 
 He smoked with lips protruding, spitting every moment, recoiling at every puff. 
 She forgot the tune of the quadrilles; she no longer saw the liveries and appointments so distinctly; some details escaped her, but the regret remained with her. 
 Often when Charles was out she took from the cupboard, between the folds of the linen where she had left it, the green silk cigar case. 
 It had been embroidered on some rosewood frame, a pretty little thing, hidden from all eyes, that had occupied many hours, and over which had fallen the soft curls of the pensive worker. A breath of love had passed over the stitches on the canvas; each prick of the needle had fixed there a hope or a memory, and all those interwoven threads of silk were but the continuity of the same silent passion. 
 And then one morning the Viscount had taken it away with him. Of what had they spoken when it lay upon the wide-mantelled chimneys between flower-vases and Pompadour clocks? 
 What a vague name! She repeated it in a low voice, for the mere pleasure of it; it rang in her ears like a great cathedral bell; it shone before her eyes, even on the labels of her pomade-pots. 
 She bought a plan of Paris, and with the tip of her finger on the map she walked about the capital. 
 She took in "La Corbeille," a lady's journal, and the "Sylphe des Salons." 
 She devoured, without skipping a word, all the accounts of first nights, races, and soirees, took interest in the debut of a singer, in the opening of a new shop. She knew the latest fashions, the addresses of the best tailors, the days of the Bois and the Opera. 
 But the circle of which he was the centre gradually widened round him, and the aureole that he bore, fading from his form, broadened out beyond, lighting up her other dreams. 
 The many lives that stirred amid this tumult were, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct pictures. 
 This was an existence outside that of all others, between heaven and earth, in the midst of storms, having something of the sublime. 
 Did not love, like Indian plants, need a special soil, a particular temperature? 
 And this was the groom in knee-britches with whom she had to be content! 
 His work done, he did not come back again all day, for Charles on his return put up his horse himself, unsaddled him and put on the halter, while the servant-girl brought a bundle of straw and threw it as best she could into the manger. 
 Madame was in her room upstairs. She wore an open dressing gown that showed between the shawl facings of her bodice a pleated chamisette with three gold buttons. 
 Her belt was a corded girdle with great tassels, and her small garnet coloured slippers had a large knot of ribbon that fell over her instep. 
 She had bought herself a blotting book, writing case, pen-holder, and envelopes, although she had no one to write to; she dusted her what-not, looked at herself in the glass, picked up a book, and then, dreaming between the lines, let it drop on her knees. 
 She longed to travel or to go back to her convent. She wished at the same time to die and to live in Paris. 
 She wanted for her mantelpiece two large blue glass vases, and some time after an ivory necessaire with a silver-gilt thimble. 
 The less Charles understood these refinements the more they seduced him. 
 It was not that he was afraid of surgery; he bled people copiously like horses, and for the taking out of teeth he had the "devil's own wrist." 
 She could have wished this name of Bovary, which was hers, had been illustrious, to see it displayed at the booksellers', repeated in the newspapers, known to all France. 
 Besides, she was becoming more irritated with him. 
 Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his waistcoat, rearranged his cravat, and threw away the dirty gloves he was going to put on; and this was not, as he fancied, for himself; it was for herself, by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation. 
 After the ennui of this disappointment her heart once more remained empty, and then the same series of days recommenced. 
 Sewing irritated her. "I have read everything," she said to herself. 
 And she sat there making the tongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling. 
 No birds were to be heard; everything seemed asleep, the espalier covered with straw, and the vine, like a great sick serpent under the coping of the wall, along which, on drawing hear, one saw the many-footed woodlice crawling. 
 Under the spruce by the hedgerow, the curie in the three-cornered hat reading his breviary had lost his right foot, and the very plaster, scaling off with the frost, had left white scabs on his face. 
 Then she went up again, shut her door, put on coals, and fainting with the heat of the hearth, felt her boredom weigh more heavily than ever. 
 From time to time the bell of a public house door rang, and when it was windy one could hear the little brass basins that served as signs for the hairdresser's shop creaking on their two rods. 
 This shop had as decoration an old engraving of a fashion-plate stuck against a windowpane and the wax bust of a woman with yellow hair. 
 Sometimes in the afternoon outside the window of her room, the head of a man appeared, a swarthy head with black whiskers, smiling slowly, with a broad, gentle smile that showed his white teeth. 
 Endless sarabands ran through her head, and, like an Indian dancing girl on the flowers of a carpet, her thoughts leapt with the notes, swung from dream to dream, from sadness to sadness. 
 She who was formerly so careful, so dainty, now passed whole days without dressing, wore grey cotton stockings, and burnt tallow candles. 
 Often she persisted in not going out, then, stifling, threw open the windows and put on light dresses. 
 Towards the end of February old Rouault, in memory of his cure, himself brought his son-in-law a superb turkey, and stayed three days at Tostes. 
 Charles being with his patients, Emma kept him company. 
 He smoked in the room, spat on the firedogs, talked farming, calves, cows, poultry, and municipal council, so that when he left she closed the door on him with a feeling of satisfaction that surprised even herself. 
 Moreover she no longer concealed her contempt for anything or anybody, and at times she set herself to express singular opinions, finding fault with that which others approved, and approving things perverse and immoral, all of which made her husband open his eyes widely. 
 On certain days she chatted with feverish rapidity, and this over-excitement was suddenly followed by a state of torpor, in which she remained without speaking, without moving. 
 What then revived her was pouring a bottle of eau-de-cologne over her arms. 
 From that moment she drank vinegar, contracted a sharp little cough, and completely lost her appetite. 
 One day when, in view of her departure, she was tidying a drawer, something pricked her finger. 
 It was a wire of her wedding bouquet. 
 Then it was, like a red bush in the cinders, slowly devoured. 
 The river that runs through it makes of it, as it were, two regions with distinct physiognomies—all on the left is pasture land, all of the right arable. 
 Here we are on the confines of Normandy, Picardy, and the Ile-de-France, a bastard land whose language is without accent and its landscape is without character. 
 It is there that they make the worst Neufchatel cheeses of all the arrondissement; and, on the other hand, farming is costly because so much manure is needed to enrich this friable soil full of sand and flints. 
 These, fenced in by hedges, are in the middle of courtyards full of straggling buildings, wine-presses, cart-sheds and distilleries scattered under thick trees, with ladders, poles, or scythes hung on to the branches. 
 Against the plaster wall diagonally crossed by black joists, a meagre pear-tree sometimes leans and the ground-floors have at their door a small swing-gate to keep out the chicks that come pilfering crumbs of bread steeped in cider on the threshold. 
 But the courtyards grow narrower, the houses closer together, and the fences disappear; a bundle of ferns swings under a window from the end of a broomstick; there is a blacksmith's forge and then a wheelwright's, with two or three new carts outside that partly block the way. 
 It is the notary's house, and the finest in the place. 
 The Church is on the other side of the street, twenty paces farther down, at the entrance of the square. 
 The little cemetery that surrounds it, closed in by a wall breast high, is so full of graves that the old stones, level with the ground, form a continuous pavement, on which the grass of itself has marked out regular green squares. 
 The church was rebuilt during the last years of the reign of Charles X. The wooden roof is beginning to rot from the top, and here and there has black hollows in its blue colour. 
 Over the door, where the organ should be, is a loft for the men, with a spiral staircase that reverberates under their wooden shoes. 
 The daylight coming through the plain glass windows falls obliquely upon the pews ranged along the walls, which are adorned here and there with a straw mat bearing beneath it the words in large letters, "Mr. So-and-so's pew." 
 The choir stalls, of deal wood, have been left unpainted. 
 The market, that is to say, a tiled roof supported by some twenty posts, occupies of itself about half the public square of Yonville. 
 Then at the back of the shop, behind the great scales fixed to the counter, the word "Laboratory" appears on a scroll above a glass door, which about half-way up once more repeats "Homais" in gold letters on a black ground. 
 If it is left on the right hand and the foot of the Saint-Jean hills followed the cemetery is soon reached. 
 From year to year, however, his small field grows smaller, and when there is an epidemic, he does not know whether to rejoice at the deaths or regret the burials. 
 On the evening when the Bovarys were to arrive at Yonville, Widow Lefrancois, the landlady of this inn, was so very busy that she sweated great drops as she moved her saucepans. 
 To-morrow was market-day. 
 If only I knew what dessert to offer the guests you are expecting! 
 Those furniture-movers are beginning their racket in the billiard-room again; and their van has been left before the front door! 
 Only think, Monsieur Homais, that since morning they have had about fifteen games, and drunk eight jars of cider! 
 "Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen's dinner?" 
 Not like Monsieur Leon; he sometimes comes at seven, or even half-past, and he doesn't so much as look at what he eats. 
 He wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his thin body, and his leather cap, with its lappets knotted over the top of his head with string, showed under the turned-up peak a bald forehead, flattened by the constant wearing of a helmet. 
 Not a hair stood out from the regular line of fair whiskers, which, encircling his jaws, framed, after the fashion of a garden border, his long, wan face, whose eyes were small and the nose hooked. 
 Then he shut the door and took off his cap in his usual way. 
 "He never talks more," she replied. 
 "Last week two travelers in the cloth line were here—such clever chaps who told such jokes in the evening, that I fairly cried with laughing; and he stood there like a dab fish and never said a word." 
 By the last gleam of the twilight one could see that his face was rubicund and his form athletic. 
 When the chemist no longer heard the noise of his boots along the square, he thought the priest's behaviour just now very unbecoming. 
 This refusal to take any refreshment seemed to him the most odious hypocrisy; all priests tippled on the sly, and were trying to bring back the days of the tithe. 
 "Besides, he could double up four men like you over his knee. 
 Last year he helped our people to bring in the straw; he carried as many as six trusses at once, he is so strong." 
 My God! 
 I am for the profession of faith of the 'Savoyard Vicar,' and the immortal principles of '89! 
 And I can't admit of an old boy of a God who takes walks in his garden with a cane in his hand, who lodges his friends in the belly of whales, dies uttering a cry, and rises again at the end of three days; things absurd in themselves, and completely opposed, moreover, to all physical laws, which prove to us, by the way, that priests have always wallowed in turpid ignorance, in which they would fain engulf the people with them." 
 He ceased, looking round for an audience, for in his bubbling over the chemist had for a moment fancied himself in the midst of the town council. 
 The small panes of the narrow windows rattled in their sashes when the coach was closed, and retained here and there patches of mud amid the old layers of dust, that not even storms of rain had altogether washed away. 
 Hivert did not know whom to answer. 
 It was he who did the errands of the place in town. 
 They had whistled for him a quarter of an hour; Hivert had even gone back a mile and a half expecting every moment to catch sight of her; but it had been necessary to go on. 
 Another had gone one hundred and fifty miles in a straight line, and swum four rivers; and his own father had possessed a poodle, which, after twelve years of absence, had all of a sudden jumped on his back in the street as he was going to dine in town. 
 It was therefore with delight that he accepted the landlady's suggestion that he should dine in company with the newcomers, and they passed into the large parlour where Madame Lefrancois, for the purpose of showing off, had had the table laid for four. 
 Homais asked to be allowed to keep on his skull-cap, for fear of coryza; then, turning to his neighbour— 
 "Oh, very few," he answered. "There is a place they call La Pature, on the top of the hill, on the edge of the forest. 
 "It is the same with mountainous landscapes," continued Leon. 
 One sees pines of incredible size across torrents, cottages suspended over precipices, and, a thousand feet below one, whole valleys when the clouds open. 
 Such spectacles must stir to enthusiasm, incline to prayer, to ecstasy; and I no longer marvel at that celebrated musician who, the better to inspire his imagination, was in the habit of playing the piano before some imposing site." 
 Leon, in fact, lodged at the chemist's where he had a small room on the second floor, overlooking the Place. 
 He blushed at the compliment of his landlord, who had already turned to the doctor, and was enumerating to him, one after the other, all the principal inhabitants of Yonville. 
 He was telling anecdotes, giving information; the fortune of the notary was not known exactly, and "there was the Tuvache household," who made a good deal of show. 
 "Oh, German music; that which makes you dream." 
 Moreover, it contains everything that is agreeable in a household—a laundry, kitchen with offices, sitting-room, fruit-room, and so on. He was a gay dog, who didn't care what he spent. 
 "One thinks of nothing," he continued; "the hours slip by. 
 She wore a small blue silk necktie, that kept up like a ruff a gauffered cambric collar, and with the movements of her head the lower part of her face gently sunk into the linen or came out from it. 
 Madame Lefrancois was asleep near the cinders, while the stable-boy, lantern in hand, was waiting to show Monsieur and Madame Bovary the way home. 
 Bits of straw stuck in his red hair, and he limped with his left leg. 
 But as the doctor's house was only some fifty paces from the inn, they had to say good-night almost immediately, and the company dispersed. 
 She could catch glimpses of tree tops, and beyond, the fields, half-drowned in the fog that lay reeking in the moonlight along the course of the river. 
 In the middle of the room, pell-mell, were scattered drawers, bottles, curtain-rods, gilt poles, with mattresses on the chairs and basins on the ground—the two men who had brought the furniture had left everything about carelessly. 
 And each one had marked, as it were, the inauguration of a new phase in her life. 
 Leon waited all day for six o'clock in the evening to come, but on going to the inn, he found no one but Monsieur Binet, already at table. The dinner of the evening before had been a considerable event for him; he had never till then talked for two hours consecutively to a "lady." 
 How then had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of things that he could not have said so well before? He was usually shy, and maintained that reserve which partakes at once of modesty and dissimulation. 
 At Yonville he was considered "well-bred." 
 He remained seated for hours without speaking, went into his consulting room to sleep, or watched his wife sewing. 
 He had spent so much for repairs at Tostes, for madame's toilette, and for the moving, that the whole dowry, over three thousand crowns, had slipped away in two years. 
 A man, at least, is free; he may travel over passions and over countries, overcome obstacles, taste of the most far-away pleasures. 
 At last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she had heard the Marchioness call a young lady Berthe; from that moment this name was chosen; and as old Rouault could not come, Monsieur Homais was requested to stand godfather. 
 This mockery of the first of the sacraments made the Abbe Bournisien angry; old Bovary replied by a quotation from "La Guerre des Dieux"; the cure wanted to leave; the ladies implored, Homais interfered; and they succeeded in making the priest sit down again, and he quietly went on with the half-finished coffee in his saucer. 
 And on the clerk's answer, she begged him to accompany her. 
 Through openings in the hedges one could see into the huts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or tethered cows rubbing their horns against the trunk of trees. 
 The two, side by side walked slowly, she leaning upon him, and he restraining his pace, which he regulated by hers; in front of them a swarm of midges fluttered, buzzing in the warm air. 
 The room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had at its farther end, against the wall, a large bed without curtains, while a kneading-trough took up the side by the window, one pane of which was mended with a piece of blue paper. 
 In the corner behind the door, shining hob-nailed shoes stood in a row under the slab of the washstand, near a bottle of oil with a feather stuck in its mouth; a Matthieu Laensberg lay on the dusty mantelpiece amid gunflints, candle-ends, and bits of amadou. 
 Finally, the last luxury in the apartment was a "Fame" blowing her trumpets, a picture cut out, no doubt, from some perfumer's prospectus and nailed to the wall with six wooden shoe-pegs. 
 The nurse at once came to dry her, protesting that it wouldn't show. 
 "She gives me other doses," she said: "I am always a-washing of her. 
 If you would have the goodness to order Camus, the grocer, to let me have a little soap, it would really be more convenient for you, as I needn't trouble you then." 
 "Very well! very well!" said Emma. "Good morning, Madame Rollet," and she went out, wiping her shoes at the door. 
 The good woman accompanied her to the end of the garden, talking all the time of the trouble she had getting up of nights. 
 "I'm that worn out sometimes as I drop asleep on my chair. 
 I'm sure you might at least give me just a pound of ground coffee; that'd last me a month, and I'd take it of a morning with some milk." 
 After having submitted to her thanks, Madam Bovary left. 
 She had gone a little way down the path when, at the sound of wooden shoes, she turned round. 
 She walked fast for some time, then more slowly, and looking straight in front of her, her eyes rested on the shoulder of the young man, whose frock-coat had a black-velvety collar. 
 His brown hair fell over it, straight and carefully arranged. 
 It was one of the clerk's chief occupations to trim them, and for this purpose he kept a special knife in his writing desk. 
 It flowed noiselessly, swift, and cold to the eye; long, thin grasses huddled together in it as the current drove them, and spread themselves upon the limpid water like streaming hair; sometimes at the tip of the reeds or on the leaf of a water-lily an insect with fine legs crawled or rested. 
 The sun pierced with a ray the small blue bubbles of the waves that, breaking, followed each other; branchless old willows mirrored their grey backs in the water; beyond, all around, the meadows seemed empty. 
 She often stopped a moment to look where to place her foot, and tottering on a stone that shook, her arms outspread, her form bent forward with a look of indecision, she would laugh, afraid of falling into the puddles of water. 
 When the first cold days set in Emma left her bedroom for the sitting-room, a long apartment with a low ceiling, in which there was on the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against the looking-glass. 
 But in the twilight, when, her chin resting on her left hand, she let the embroidery she had begun fall on her knees, she often shuddered at the apparition of this shadow suddenly gliding past. 
 Moreover, Homais, with his head fuller of recipes than his shop of jars, excelled in making all kinds of preserves, vinegars, and sweet liqueurs; he knew also all the latest inventions in economic stoves, together with the art of preserving cheese and of curing sick wines. 
 On Sunday, for example, one could not get him out of the drawing-room, whither Madame Homais had called him to fetch the children, who were falling asleep in the arm-chairs, and dragging down with their backs calico chair-covers that were too large. 
 As soon as he heard the bell he ran to meet Madame Bovary, took her shawl, and put away under the shop-counter the thick list shoes that she wore over her boots when there was snow. 
 With every movement that she made to throw her cards the right side of her dress was drawn up. 
 Leon sat down near her; they looked at the engravings together, and waited for one another at the bottom of the pages. 
 She often begged him to read her the verses; Leon declaimed them in a languid voice, to which he carefully gave a dying fall in the love passages. 
 The fire was dying out in the cinders; the teapot was empty, Leon was still reading. 
 Emma listened to him, mechanically turning around the lampshade, on the gauze of which were painted clowns in carriages, and tight-rope dances with their balancing-poles. 
 He showed him many others, even to doing errands for him at Rouen; and the book of a novelist having made the mania for cactuses fashionable, Leon bought some for Madame Bovary, bringing them back on his knees in the "Hirondelle," pricking his fingers on their hard hairs. 
 She had a board with a balustrade fixed against her window to hold the pots. The clerk, too, had his small hanging garden; they saw each other tending their flowers at their windows. 
 One evening on coming home Leon found in his room a rug in velvet and wool with leaves on a pale ground. 
 He tortured himself to find out how he could make his declaration to her, and always halting between the fear of displeasing her and the shame of being such a coward, he wept with discouragement and desire. 
 Her husband, was he not something belonging to her? 
 He explained to the company the future importance of this establishment, computed the strength of the floorings, the thickness of the walls, and regretted extremely not having a yard-stick such as Monsieur Binet possessed for his own special use. 
 She turned. 
 Charles was there. 
 His cap was drawn down over his eyebrows, and his two thick lips were trembling, which added a look of stupidity to his face; his very back, his calm back, was irritating to behold, and she saw written upon his coat all the platitude of the bearer. 
 "Yes, charming! charming! Is he not in love?" she asked herself; "but with whom? 
 Born a Gascon but bred a Norman, he grafted upon his southern volubility the cunning of the Cauchois. 
 A poor shop like his was not made to attract a "fashionable lady"; he emphasized the words; yet she had only to command, and he would undertake to provide her with anything she might wish, either in haberdashery or linen, millinery or fancy goods, for he went to town regularly four times a month. 
 He was connected with the best houses. You could speak of him at the "Trois Freres," at the "Barbe d'Or," or at the "Grand Sauvage"; all these gentlemen knew him as well as the insides of their pockets. 
 "Ah!" said he quickly and in a low voice, "I shouldn't have to go far to find you some, rely on that." 
 I, too, don't feel the thing. 
 One of these days I shall even have to consult the doctor for a pain I have in my back. 
 The clerk was fond of Monsieur Bovary. 
 When Charles came home he found his slippers put to warm near the fire. 
 And thus she seemed so virtuous and inaccessible to him that he lost all hope, even the faintest. 
 To him she stood outside those fleshly attributes from which he had nothing to obtain, and in his heart she rose ever, and became farther removed from him after the magnificent manner of an apotheosis that is taking wing. 
 Emma thrilled at the sound of his step; then in his presence the emotion subsided, and afterwards there remained to her only an immense astonishment that ended in sorrow. 
 His conviction that he was making her happy seemed to her an imbecile insult, and his sureness on this point ingratitude. 
 Was it not for him, the obstacle to all felicity, the cause of all misery, and, as it were, the sharp clasp of that complex strap that bucked her in on all sides. 
 On him alone, then, she concentrated all the various hatreds that resulted from her boredom, and every effort to diminish only augmented it; for this useless trouble was added to the other reasons for despair, and contributed still more to the separation between them. 
 Her own gentleness to herself made her rebel against him. 
 Domestic mediocrity drove her to lewd fancies, marriage tenderness to adulterous desires. 
 "Why don't you tell master?" the servant asked her when she came in during these crises. 
 "Do not speak to him of it; it would worry him." 
 She was so sad, so sad, to see her standing upright on the threshold of her house, she seemed to you like a winding-sheet spread out before the door. 
 It was the beginning of April, when the primroses are in bloom, and a warm wind blows over the flower-beds newly turned, and the gardens, like women, seem to be getting ready for the summer fetes. 
 Through the bars of the arbour and away beyond, the river seen in the fields, meandering through the grass in wandering curves. 
 At mass on Sundays, when she looked up, she saw the gentle face of the Virgin amid the blue smoke of the rising incense. Then she was moved; she felt herself weak and quite deserted, like the down of a bird whirled by the tempest, and it was unconsciously that she went towards the church, included to no matter what devotions, so that her soul was absorbed and all existence lost in it. 
 The children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an enclosure made for them. The shouts of their voices could be heard through the humming of the bell. 
 A long ray of the sun fell across the nave and seemed to darken the lower sides and the corners. 
 "Where is the cure?" asked Madame Bovary of one of the lads, who was amusing himself by shaking a swivel in a hole too large for it. 
 Grease and tobacco stains followed along his broad chest the lines of the buttons, and grew more numerous the farther they were from his neckcloth, in which the massive folds of his red chin rested; this was dotted with yellow spots, that disappeared beneath the coarse hair of his greyish beard. 
 He had just dined and was breathing noisily. 
 But the cure from time to time looked into the church, where the kneeling boys were shouldering one another, and tumbling over like packs of cards. 
 Yet he could learn quickly if he would, for he is very sharp. And so sometimes for a joke I call him Riboudet (like the road one takes to go to Maromme) and I even say 'Mon Riboudet.' 
 "Always very busy, no doubt; for he and I are certainly the busiest people in the parish. 
 But he is doctor of the body," he added with a thick laugh, "and I of the soul." 
 This morning I had to go to Bas-Diauville for a cow that was ill; they thought it was under a spell. 
 Longuemarre and Boudet! 
 Will you leave off?" 
 The boys were just then clustering round the large desk, climbing over the precentor's footstool, opening the missal; and others on tiptoe were just about to venture into the confessional. 
 You must get home, Madame Bovary; drink a little tea, that will strengthen you, or else a glass of fresh water with a little moist sugar." 
 "Well, you see, you were putting your hand to your forehead. I thought you felt faint." 
 The first communion will soon be upon us, and I fear we shall be behind after all. 
 Emma saw him disappear between the double row of forms, walking with a heavy tread, his head a little bent over his shoulder, and with his two hands half-open behind him. 
 The fire was out, the clock went on ticking, and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm of all things while within herself was such tumult. 
 But little Berthe was there, between the window and the work-table, tottering on her knitted shoes, and trying to come to her mother to catch hold of the ends of her apron-strings. 
 Berthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle, cutting her cheek, which began to bleed, against it. 
 Madame Bovary sprang to lift her up, broke the bell-rope, called for the servant with all her might, and she was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared. 
 Charles reassured her; the case was not a serious one, and he went for some sticking plaster. 
 When at eleven o'clock Charles came back from the chemist's shop, whither he had gone after dinner to return the remainder of the sticking-plaster, he found his wife standing by the cradle. 
 He had stayed a long time at the chemist's. 
 Although he had not seemed much moved, Homais, nevertheless, had exerted himself to buoy him up, to "keep up his spirits." 
 Then they had talked of the various dangers that threaten childhood, of the carelessness of servants. 
 Madame Homais knew something of it, having still upon her chest the marks left by a basin full of soup that a cook had formerly dropped on her pinafore, and her good parents took no end of trouble for her. 
 He even went so far as to say to her, "Do you want to make Caribs or Botocudos of them?" 
 "I should like to speak to you," he had whispered in the clerk's ear, who went upstairs in front of him. 
 "Can he suspect anything?" Leon asked himself. 
 It was a sentimental surprise he intended for his wife, a delicate attention—his portrait in a frock-coat. 
 All the same, his companion seemed very strange to him, for Leon often threw himself back in his chair, and stretching out his arms. Complained vaguely of life. 
 "Ah! that's true," said the other, rubbing his chin with an air of mingled contempt and satisfaction. 
 This apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris from afar sounded its fanfare of masked balls with the laugh of grisettes. 
 As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at once? 
 What prevented him? And he began making home-preparations; he arranged his occupations beforehand. 
 He furnished in his head an apartment. He would lead an artist's life there! 
 The difficulty was the consent of his mother; nothing, however, seemed more reasonable. 
 Taking a middle course, then, Leon looked for some place as second clerk at Rouen; found none, and at last wrote his mother a long letter full of details, in which he set forth the reasons for going to live at Paris immediately. 
 "Embrace me," said the druggist with tears in his eyes. 
 "Good-night," said Monsieur Guillaumin. "Give him his head." 
 Madame Bovary had opened her window overlooking the garden and watched the clouds. 
 They gathered around the sunset on the side of Rouen and then swiftly rolled back their black columns, behind which the great rays of the sun looked out like the golden arrows of a suspended trophy, while the rest of the empty heavens was white as porcelain. 
 But a gust of wind bowed the poplars, and suddenly the rain fell; it pattered against the green leaves. 
 Then the sun reappeared, the hens clucked, sparrows shook their wings in the damp thickets, and the pools of water on the gravel as they flowed away carried off the pink flowers of an acacia. 
 "Well," said he, "so we've sent off our young friend!" 
 Then turning on his chair; "Any news at home?" 
 "The outings at restaurants, the masked balls, the champagne—all that'll be jolly enough, I assure you." 
 "But," said the doctor, "I fear for him that down there—" 
 "That is true," said Charles; "but I was thinking especially of illnesses—of typhoid fever, for example, that attacks students from the provinces." 
 "Not a moment's peace!" he cried; "always at it! 
 "That it is very likely," Homais went on, raising his eyebrows and assuming one of his most serious expression, "that the agricultural meeting of the Seine-Inferieure will be held this year at Yonville-l'Abbaye. 
 The rumour, at all events, is going the round. 
 Everything seemed to her enveloped in a black atmosphere floating confusedly over the exterior of things, and sorrow was engulfed within her soul with soft shrieks such as the winter wind makes in ruined castles. 
 Though separated from her, he had not left her; he was there, and the walls of the house seemed to hold his shadow. 
 He read aloud, bareheaded, sitting on a footstool of dry sticks; the fresh wind of the meadow set trembling the leaves of the book and the nasturtiums of the arbour. 
 Ah! he was gone, the only charm of her life, the only possible hope of joy. Why had she not seized this happiness when it came to her? 
 The wish took possession of her to run after and rejoin him, throw herself into his arms and say to him, "It is I; I am yours." 
 But Emma recoiled beforehand at the difficulties of the enterprise, and her desires, increased by regret, became only the more acute. 
 Sometimes in the night Charles woke up with a start, thinking he was being called to a patient. "I'm coming," he stammered; and it was the noise of a match Emma had struck to relight the lamp. 
 But her reading fared like her piece of embroidery, all of which, only just begun, filled her cupboard; she took it up, left it, passed on to other books. 
 She maintained one day, in opposition to her husband, that she could drink off a large glass of brandy, and, as Charles was stupid enough to dare her to, she swallowed the brandy to the last drop. 
 In spite of her vapourish airs (as the housewives of Yonville called them), Emma, all the same, never seemed gay, and usually she had at the corners of her mouth that immobile contraction that puckers the faces of old maids, and those of men whose ambition has failed. 
 She was pale all over, white as a sheet; the skin of her nose was drawn at the nostrils, her eyes looked at you vaguely. 
 She often fainted. 
 Anyone who has no religion always ends by turning out badly." 
 She was, when she passed through Rouen, to go herself to the lending-library and represent that Emma had discontinued her subscription. 
 During the three weeks that they had been together they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words apart from the inquiries and phrases when they met at table and in the evening before going to bed. 
 The coarse hardware was spread out on the ground between pyramids of eggs and hampers of cheeses, from which sticky straw stuck out. 
 On Wednesdays his shop was never empty, and the people pushed in less to buy drugs than for consultations. 
 Emma was leaning out at the window; she was often there. 
 He had on yellow gloves, although he wore heavy gaiters; he was coming towards the doctor's house, followed by a peasant walking with a bent head and quite a thoughtful air. 
 "Sometimes," answered the doctor, "one feels nothing at first, and then syncope sets in, and more especially with people of strong constitution like this man." 
 At these words the rustic let go the lancet-case he was twisting between his fingers. A shudder of his shoulders made the chair-back creak. 
 Then she went to fetch a bottle of water, and she was melting some pieces of sugar when the chemist arrived. 
 Seeing his pupil's eyes staring he drew a long breath; then going around him he looked at him from head to foot. 
 "Fool!" he said, "really a little fool! 
 A phlebotomy's a big affair, isn't it! 
 Here's a fine fitness for practising pharmacy later on; for under serious circumstances you may be called before the tribunals in order to enlighten the minds of the magistrates, and you would have to keep your head then, to reason, show yourself a man, or else pass for an imbecile." 
 "Who asked you to come? 
 "She is very pretty," he said to himself; "she is very pretty, this doctor's wife. 
 The fields were empty, and around him Rodolphe only heard the regular beating of the grass striking against his boots, with a cry of the grasshopper hidden at a distance among the oats. 
 On that day he wore a collar even higher than usual; and, tightly buttoned in his tunic, his figure was so stiff and motionless that the whole vital portion of his person seemed to have descended into his legs, which rose in a cadence of set steps with a single movement. 
 The crowd came into the main street from both ends of the village. People poured in from the lanes, the alleys, the houses; and from time to time one heard knockers banging against doors closing behind women with their gloves, who were going out to see the fete. 
 Besides this there were against the four columns of the town hall four kinds of poles, each bearing a small standard of greenish cloth, embellished with inscriptions in gold letters. 
 On one was written, "To Commerce"; on the other, "To Agriculture"; on the third, "To Industry"; and on the fourth, "To the Fine Arts." 
 But the jubilation that brightened all faces seemed to darken that of Madame Lefrancois, the innkeeper. 
 And one must be master of all the principles of hygiene in order to direct, criticize the construction of buildings, the feeding of animals, the diet of domestics. 
 "Would to God our agriculturists were chemists, or that at least they would pay more attention to the counsels of science. 
 Thus lately I myself wrote a considerable tract, a memoir of over seventy-two pages, entitled, 'Cider, its Manufacture and its Effects, together with some New Reflections on the Subject,' that I sent to the Agricultural Society of Rouen, and which even procured me the honour of being received among its members—Section, Agriculture; Class, Pomological. 
 Well, if my work had been given to the public—" But the druggist stopped, Madame Lefrancois seemed so preoccupied. 
 "Just look at them!" she said. "It's past comprehension! 
 Such a cookshop as that!" And with a shrug of the shoulders that stretched out over her breast the stitches of her knitted bodice, she pointed with both hands at her rival's inn, whence songs were heard issuing. 
 "There!" she said. 
 "Look at him! he is in the market; he is bowing to Madame Bovary, who's got on a green bonnet. 
 A pink line ran along the partition between her nostrils. Her head was bent upon her shoulder, and the pearl tips of her white teeth were seen between her lips. 
 Emma's gesture, however, had only been meant for a warning; for Monsieur Lheureux was accompanying them, and spoke now and again as if to enter into the conversation. 
 "What a superb day! Everybody is out! 
 "Here are some pretty Easter daisies," he said, "and enough of them to furnish oracles to all the amorous maids in the place." 
 The meadow began to fill, and the housewives hustled you with their great umbrellas, their baskets, and their babies. 
 One had often to get out of the way of a long file of country folk, servant-maids with blue stockings, flat shoes, silver rings, and who smelt of milk, when one passed close to them. 
 They walked along holding one another by the hand, and thus they spread over the whole field from the row of open trees to the banquet tent. But this was the examination time, and the farmers one after the other entered a kind of enclosure formed by a long cord supported on sticks. 
 The beasts were there, their noses towards the cord, and making a confused line with their unequal rumps. 
 Drowsy pigs were burrowing in the earth with their snouts, calves were bleating, lambs baaing; the cows, on knees folded in, were stretching their bellies on the grass, slowly chewing the cud, and blinking their heavy eyelids at the gnats that buzzed round them. 
 Plough-men with bare arms were holding by the halter prancing stallions that neighed with dilated nostrils looking towards the mares. 
 He noticed this, and began jeering at the Yonville ladies and their dresses; then he apologised for the negligence of his own. 
 Thus his cambric shirt with plaited cuffs was blown out by the wind in the opening of his waistcoat of grey ticking, and his broad-striped trousers disclosed at the ankle nankeen boots with patent leather gaiters. 
 He trampled on horses's dung with them, one hand in the pocket of his jacket and his straw hat on one side. 
 Then they talked about provincial mediocrity, of the lives it crushed, the illusions lost there. 
 I seem so, because in the midst of the world I know how to wear the mask of a scoffer upon my face; and yet, how many a time at the sight of a cemetery by moonlight have I not asked myself whether it were not better to join those sleeping there!" 
 He was so overladen with them that one could only see the tips of his wooden shoes and the ends of his two outstretched arms. 
 At last at the end of the Place a large hired landau appeared, drawn by two thin horses, which a coachman in a white hat was whipping lustily. 
 A few even forgot their collars; but the equipage of the prefect seemed to anticipate the crowd, and the two yoked jades, trapesing in their harness, came up at a little trot in front of the peristyle of the town hall at the very moment when the National Guard and firemen deployed, beating drums and marking time. 
 "Left about, march." 
 And after presenting arms, during which the clang of the band, letting loose, rang out like a brass kettle rolling downstairs, all the guns were lowered. 
 Then was seen stepping down from the carriage a gentleman in a short coat with silver braiding, with bald brow, and wearing a tuft of hair at the back of his head, of a sallow complexion and the most benign appearance. 
 He recognised the mayor by his scarf, and explained to him that the prefect was not able to come. 
 The councillor pressing his little cocked hat to his breast repeated his bows, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, also smiled, stammered, tried to say something, protested his devotion to the monarchy and the honour that was being done to Yonville. 
 Their fair flabby faces, somewhat tanned by the sun, were the colour of sweet cider, and their puffy whiskers emerged from stiff collars, kept up by white cravats with broad bows. 
 All the waist-coats were of velvet, double-breasted; all the watches had, at the end of a long ribbon, an oval cornelian seal; everyone rested his two hands on his thighs, carefully stretching the stride of their trousers, whose unsponged glossy cloth shone more brilliantly than the leather of their heavy boots. 
 As a matter of fact, Lestiboudois had brought thither all those that he had moved from the field, and he even kept running back every minute to fetch others from the church. 
 Everywhere commerce and the arts are flourishing; everywhere new means of communication, like so many new arteries in the body of the state, establish within it new relations. 
 Our great industrial centres have recovered all their activity; religion, more consolidated, smiles in all hearts; our ports are full, confidence is born again, and France breathes once more!" 
 They need by turns to dream and to act, the purest passions and the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling themselves into all sorts of fantasies, of follies." 
 Then she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has voyaged over strange lands, and went on— 
 "It comes one day," repeated Rodolphe, "one day suddenly, and when one is despairing of it. Then the horizon expands; it is as if a voice cried, 'It is here!' 
 There is no need for explanations; they understand one another. They have seen each other in dreams!" 
 "In fine, here it is, this treasure so sought after, here before you. 
 It glitters, it flashes; yet one still doubts, one does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if one went out iron darkness into light." 
 And as he ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. 
 She took hers away. 
 But the other, the eternal, that is about us and above, like the landscape that surrounds us, and the blue heavens that give us light." 
 Who has not frequently reflected on all the momentous things that we get out of that modest animal, the ornament of poultry-yards, that provides us at once with a soft pillow for our bed, with succulent flesh for our tables, and eggs? 
 He had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude were wide open, as if to drink in his words. 
 The firemen at the foot of the platform rested on their bayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with out-turned elbows, the point of his sabre in the air. 
 Perhaps he could hear, but certainly he could see nothing, because of the visor of his helmet, that fell down on his nose. 
 His lieutenant, the youngest son of Monsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his was enormous, and shook on his head, and from it an end of his cotton scarf peeped out. 
 One saw folk leaning on their elbows at all the windows, others standing at doors, and Justin, in front of the chemist's shop, seemed quite transfixed by the sight of what he was looking at. 
 It reached you in fragments of phrases, and interrupted here and there by the creaking of chairs in the crowd; then you suddenly heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the bleating of the lambs, who answered one another at street corners. 
 In fact, the cowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus far, and these lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore down some scrap of foliage that hung above their mouths. 
 Then a faintness came over her; she recalled the Viscount who had waltzed with her at Vaubyessard, and his beard exhaled like this air an odour of vanilla and citron, and mechanically she half-closed her eyes the better to breathe it in. 
 She fancied she saw him opposite at his windows; then all grew confused; clouds gathered; it seemed to her that she was again turning in the waltz under the light of the lustres on the arm of the Viscount, and that Leon was not far away, that he was coming; and yet all the time she was conscious of the scent of Rodolphe's head by her side. 
 This sweetness of sensation pierced through her old desires, and these, like grains of sand under a gust of wind, eddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which suffused her soul. 
 Let these shows be to you pacific arenas, where the victor in leaving it will hold forth a hand to the vanquished, and will fraternise with him in the hope of better success. 
 His was not perhaps so florid as that of the councillor, but it recommended itself by a more direct style, that is to say, by more special knowledge and more elevated considerations. 
 I shall be something in your thought, in your life, shall I not?" 
 A gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on the table, and in the square below all the great caps of the peasant women were uplifted by it like the wings of white butterflies fluttering. 
 "Use of oil-cakes," continued the president. 
 Her pale face framed in a borderless cap was more wrinkled than a withered russet apple. 
 Something of monastic rigidity dignified her face. 
 In her constant living with animals she had caught their dumbness and their calm. 
 Behind him on the grass the servants were piling up the dirty plates, his neighbours were talking; he did not answer them; they filled his glass, and there was silence in his thoughts in spite of the growing noise. 
 He was dreaming of what she had said, of the line of her lips; her face, as in a magic mirror, shone on the plates of the shakos, the folds of her gown fell along the walls, and days of love unrolled to all infinity before him in the vistas of the future. 
 "Truly," said the druggist, "one ought to proceed most rigorously against drunkenness! I should like to see written up weekly at the door of the town hall on a board ad hoc* the names of all those who during the week got intoxicated on alcohol. 
 Besides, with regard to statistics, one would thus have, as it were, public records that one could refer to in case of need. 
 And he once more ran off to the captain. 
 "Leave me alone!" answered the tax-collector. "It's all right!" 
 "Do not be uneasy," said the druggist, when he returned to his friends. "Monsieur Binet has assured me that all precautions have been taken. 
 Rodolphe repeated in a low voice, and with a tender look, "Oh, yes! very beautiful!" 
 "Courage!" he cried to it; "a thousand reforms are indispensable; let us accomplish them!" 
 When he came to the distribution of the prizes, he painted the joy of the prize-winners in dithyrambic strophes. "The father embraced the son, the brother the brother, the husband his consort. 
 One would have called it a veritable kaleidoscope, a real operatic scene; and for a moment our little locality might have thought itself transported into the midst of a dream of the 'Thousand and One Nights.' 
 Let us state that no untoward event disturbed this family meeting." 
 The day after the show he had said to himself—"We mustn't go back too soon; that would be a mistake." 
 "How kind it would be of you," he went on, rising, "if you would humour a whim of mine." 
 It was to go over her house; he wanted to know it; and Madame Bovary seeing no objection to this, they both rose, when Charles came in. 
 Charles interrupted him; he had indeed a thousand anxieties; his wife's palpitations of the heart were beginning again. 
 "Certainly! excellent! just the thing! 
 Then to explain his visit he said that his ploughman, the man of the blood-letting, still suffered from giddiness. 
 And as soon as they were alone, "Why don't you accept Monsieur Boulanger's kind offer?" 
 She assumed a sulky air, invented a thousand excuses, and finally declared that perhaps it would look odd. 
 "And how do you think I can ride when I haven't got a habit?" 
 He was giving Monsieur Boulanger a little good advice. 
 She heard a noise above her; it was Felicite drumming on the windowpanes to amuse little Berthe. 
 And he flourished his newspaper as he saw them disappear. 
 Rodolphe galloped by her side. 
 Now and then they exchanged a word. 
 At the bottom of the hill Rodolphe gave his horse its head; they started together at a bound, then at the top suddenly the horses stopped, and her large blue veil fell about her. 
 Sometimes through a rift in the clouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of Yonville, with the gardens at the water's edge, the yards, the walls and the church steeple. 
 The earth, ruddy like the powder of tobacco, deadened the noise of their steps, and with the edge of their shoes the horses as they walked kicked the fallen fir cones in front of them. 
 Long ferns by the roadside caught in Emma's stirrup. 
 Often in the thicket was heard the fluttering of wings, or else the hoarse, soft cry of the ravens flying off amidst the oaks. 
 They dismounted. 
 Rodolphe fastened up the horses. 
 She walked on in front on the moss between the paths. 
 Rodolphe looked round him biting his moustache. They came to a larger space where the coppice had been cut. 
 They sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and Rodolphe began speaking to her of his love. He did not begin by frightening her with compliments. 
 But at the words, "Are not our destinies now one?" 
 She feebly tried to disengage herself. 
 He supported her thus as they walked along. 
 "Oh! one moment!" said Rodolphe. 
 The shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing between the branches dazzled the eyes. 
 Here and there around her, in the leaves or on the ground, trembled luminous patches, as it hummingbirds flying about had scattered their feathers. 
 Silence was everywhere; something sweet seemed to come forth from the trees; she felt her heart, whose beating had begun again, and the blood coursing through her flesh like a stream of milk. 
 Then far away, beyond the wood, on the other hills, she heard a vague prolonged cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she heard it mingling like music with the last pulsations of her throbbing nerves. 
 They returned to Yonville by the same road. On the mud they saw again the traces of their horses side by side, the same thickets, the same stones to the grass; nothing around them seemed changed; and yet for her something had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved in their places. 
 "Well, I spent the afternoon at Monsieur Alexandre's. 
 Never had her eyes been so large, so black, of so profound a depth. 
 She repeated, "I have a lover! a lover!" delighting at the idea as if a second puberty had come to her. So at last she was to know those joys of love, that fever of happiness of which she had despaired! 
 Then she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read, and the lyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in her memory with the voice of sisters that charmed her. 
 She became herself, as it were, an actual part of these imaginings, and realised the love-dream of her youth as she saw herself in this type of amorous women whom she had so envied. 
 This idea made her pant with desire, and she soon found herself in the middle of the field, walking with rapid steps, without looking behind her. 
 Beyond the farmyard there was a detached building that she thought must be the chateau She entered—it was if the doors at her approach had opened wide of their own accord. 
 Emma raised the latch of a door, and suddenly at the end of the room she saw a man sleeping. 
 Emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes, while the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole around her face. 
 Often she even put between her teeth the big pipe that lay on the table by the bed, amongst lemons and pieces of sugar near a bottle of water. 
 Something stronger than herself forced her to him; so much so, that one day, seeing her come unexpectedly, he frowned as one put out. 
 But now that he was indispensable to her life, she feared to lose anything of this, or even that it should be disturbed. 
 When she came back from his house she looked all about her, anxiously watching every form that passed in the horizon, and every village window from which she could be seen. 
 One morning as she was thus returning, she suddenly thought she saw the long barrel of a carbine that seemed to be aimed at her. 
 He had gaiters buckled up to the knees, his cap pulled down over his eyes, trembling lips, and a red nose. 
 Charles after dinner, seeing her gloomy, proposed, by way of distraction, to take her to the chemist's, and the first person she caught sight of in the shop was the taxcollector again. 
 He was standing in front of the counter, lit up by the gleams of the red bottle, and was saying— 
 You'd better fetch some chairs from the little room; you know very well that the arm-chairs are not to be taken out of the drawing-room." 
 And to put his arm-chair back in its place he was darting away from the counter, when Binet asked him for half an ounce of sugar acid. 
 "Indeed the weather is not propitious on account of the damp." 
 "Nevertheless," replied the tax-collector, with a sly look, "there are people who like it." 
 "And give me—" 
 "Will he never go?" thought she. "Half an ounce of resin and turpentine, four ounces of yellow wax, and three half ounces of animal charcoal, if you please, to clean the varnished leather of my togs." 
 Emma wanted to bribe her servant with a present, but it would be better to find some safe house at Yonville. 
 She was wild with impatience; if her eyes could have done it, she would have hurled him out at the window. 
 Then, as the candles dazzled him; he turned to the wall and fell asleep. 
 Rodolphe had a large cloak; he wrapped her in it, and putting his arm round her waist, he drew her without a word to the end of the garden. 
 She never thought of him now. 
 She was wonder-stricken at his bravery, although she felt in it a sort of indecency and a naive coarseness that scandalised her. 
 Rodolphe reflected a good deal on the affair of the pistols. 
 If she had spoken seriously, it was very ridiculous, he thought, even odious; for he had no reason to hate the good Charles, not being what is called devoured by jealousy; and on this subject Emma had taken a great vow that he did not think in the best of taste. 
 She had insisted on exchanging miniatures; they had cut off handfuls of hair, and now she was asking for a ring—a real wedding-ring, in sign of an eternal union. 
 She did not know if she regretted having yielded to him, or whether she did not wish, on the contrary, to enjoy him the more. 
 "My Dear Children—I hope this will find you well, and that this one will be as good as the others. For it seems to me a little more tender, if I may venture to say so, and heavier. 
 "For myself, I am very well, except for a cold I caught the other day at the fair at Yvetot, where I had gone to hire a shepherd, having turned away mine because he was too dainty. 
 Besides, he was also rude. I heard from a pedlar, who, travelling through your part of the country this winter, had a tooth drawn, that Bovary was as usual working hard. 
 So much the better, my dear children, and may God send you every imaginable happiness! 
 It grieves me not yet to have seen my dear little grand-daughter, Berthe Bovary. 
 I have planted an Orleans plum-tree for her in the garden under your room, and I won't have it touched unless it is to have jam made for her by and bye, that I will keep in the cupboard for her when she comes. 
 She remembered the summer evenings all full of sunshine. The colts neighed when anyone passed by, and galloped, galloped. 
 In fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the midst of the grass that was being turned. 
 Lestiboudois was raking by her side, and every time he came near she lent forward, beating the air with both her arms. 
 "Bring her to me," said her mother, rushing to embrace her. "How I love you, my poor child! 
 But he gave her no opportunities for such a revival of sentiment, so that she was much embarrassed by her desire for sacrifice, when the druggist came just in time to provide her with an opportunity. 
 "You will scarcely feel, probably, a slight pain; it is a simple prick, like a little blood-letting, less than the extraction of certain corns." 
 Then Homais represented to him how much jollier and brisker he would feel afterwards, and even gave him to understand that he would be more likely to please the women; and the stable-boy began to smile heavily. Then he attacked him through his vanity: 
 And Homais retired, declaring that he could not understand this obstinacy, this blindness in refusing the benefactions of science. 
 So by the advice of the chemist, and after three fresh starts, he had a kind of box made by the carpenter, with the aid of the locksmith, that weighed about eight pounds, and in which iron, wood, sheer-iron, leather, screws, and nuts had not been spared. 
 He had a foot forming almost a straight line with the leg, which, however, did not prevent it from being turned in, so that it was an equinus together with something of a varus, or else a slight varus with a strong tendency to equinus. 
 It was Monsieur Homais who since morning had been organising all these preparations, as much to dazzle the multitude as to keep up his illusions. 
 Then Charles, having buckled his patient into the machine, went home, where Emma, all anxiety, awaited him at the door. 
 She threw herself on his neck; they sat down to table; he ate much, and at dessert he even wanted to take a cup of coffee, a luxury he only permitted himself on Sundays when there was company. 
 The evening was charming, full of prattle, of dreams together. 
 They talked about their future fortune, of the improvements to be made in their house; he saw people's estimation of him growing, his comforts increasing, his wife always loving him; and she was happy to refresh herself with a new sentiment, healthier, better, to feel at last some tenderness for this poor fellow who adored her. 
 Thus on Tuesday our little town of Yonville found itself the scene of a surgical operation which is at the same time an act of loftiest philanthropy. 
 The masses must—'" 
 "I proceed," said the chemist. "'Monsieur Bovary, one of our most distinguished practitioners, performed an operation on a club-footed man called Hippolyte Tautain, stableman for the last twenty-five years at the hotel of the "Lion d'Or," kept by Widow Lefrancois, at the Place d'Armes. 
 The operation, moreover, was performed as if by magic, and barely a few drops of blood appeared on the skin, as though to say that the rebellious tendon had at last given way beneath the efforts of art. 
 Everything tends to show that his convelescence will be brief; and who knows even if at our next village festivity we shall not see our good Hippolyte figuring in the bacchic dance in the midst of a chorus of joyous boon-companions, and thus proving to all eyes by his verve and his capers his complete cure? 
 Honour, then, to the generous savants! Honour to those indefatigable spirits who consecrate their vigils to the amelioration or to the alleviation of their kind! 
 Charles rushed to the "Lion d'Or," and the chemist, who caught sight of him passing along the Place hatless, abandoned his shop. 
 With many precautions, in order not to disturb the position of the limb, the box was removed, and an awful sight presented itself. 
 Hippolyte had already complained of suffering from it. No attention had been paid to him; they had to acknowledge that he had not been altogether wrong, and he was freed for a few hours. 
 You should do this! do that!" 
 And she gave him some good beef-tea, a slice of mutton, a piece of bacon, and sometimes small glasses of brandy, that he had not the strength to put to his lips. 
 He began by pitying his sufferings, declaring at the same time that he ought to rejoice at them since it was the will of the Lord, and take advantage of the occasion to reconcile himself to Heaven. 
 Thus, as a precaution, what is to prevent you from saying morning and evening a 'Hail Mary, full of grace,' and 'Our Father which art in heaven'? 
 But the good woman would no longer listen to him; he was the cause of it all. 
 From a spirit of contradiction she hung up near the bedside of the patient a basin filled with holy-water and a branch of box. 
 Then having flatly declared that it must be amputated, he went off to the chemist's to rail at the asses who could have reduced a poor man to such a state. 
 It is like strabismus, chloroform, lithotrity, a heap of monstrosities that the Government ought to prohibit. 
 So he did not take up the defence of Bovary; he did not even make a single remark, and, renouncing his principles, he sacrificed his dignity to the more serious interests of his business. 
 On that day all the inhabitants got up earlier, and the Grande Rue, although full of people, had something lugubrious about it, as if an execution had been expected. 
 At the grocer's they discussed Hippolyte's illness; the shops did no business, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's wife, did not stir from her window, such was her impatience to see the operator arrive. 
 But the springs of the right side having at length given way beneath the weight of his corpulence, it happened that the carriage as it rolled along leaned over a little, and on the other cushion near him could be seen a large box covered in red sheep-leather, whose three brass clasps shone grandly. 
 Then he went into the stable to see that he was eating his oats all right; for on arriving at a patient's he first of all looked after his mare and his gig. 
 And he was the more esteemed for this imperturbable coolness. The universe to the last man might have died, and he would not have missed the smallest of his habits. 
 "Pshaw!" interrupted Canivet; "on the contrary, you seem to me inclined to apoplexy. 
 I get up every day at four o'clock; I shave with cold water (and am never cold). 
 I don't wear flannels, and I never catch cold; my carcass is good enough! 
 I live now in one way, now in another, like a philosopher, taking pot-luck; that is why I am not squeamish like you, and it is as indifferent to me to carve a Christian as the first fowl that turns up. 
 Polemics would ensue; he would have to answer in the papers. 
 Emma, opposite, watched him; she did not share his humiliation; she felt another—that of having supposed such a man was worth anything. 
 As if twenty times already she had not sufficiently perceived his mediocrity. 
 In the midst of the silence that hung over the village a heart-rending cry rose on the air. 
 Often, even in the middle of the day, Emma suddenly wrote to him, then from the window made a sign to Justin, who, taking his apron off, quickly ran to La Huchette. 
 "We would go and live elsewhere—somewhere!" 
 "You are really mad!" he said laughing. "How could that be possible?" 
 She returned to the subject; he pretended not to understand, and turned the conversation. 
 Her tenderness, in fact, grew each day with her repulsion to her husband. 
 Then, while playing the spouse and virtue, she was burning at the thought of that head whose black hair fell in a curl over the sunburnt brow, of that form at once so strong and elegant, of that man, in a word, who had such experience in his reasoning, such passion in his desires. 
 The servant had to be constantly washing linen, and all day Felicite did not stir from the kitchen, where little Justin, who often kept her company, watched her at work. 
 "Let me alone," she said, moving her pot of starch. 
 It was Monsieur Lheureux, the shopkeeper, who had undertaken the order; this provided him with an excuse for visiting Emma. 
 Emma yielded to this lazy mode of satisfying all her caprices. 
 Thus she wanted to have a very handsome ridding-whip that was at an umbrella-maker's at Rouen to give to Rodolphe. 
 But the next day he called on her with a bill for two hundred and seventy francs, not counting the centimes. 
 Emma was much embarrassed; all the drawers of the writing-table were empty; they owed over a fortnight's wages to Lestiboudois, two quarters to the servant, for any quantity of other things, and Bovary was impatiently expecting Monsieur Derozeray's account, which he was in the habit of paying every year about Midsummer. 
 She was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming in put on the mantelpiece a small roll of blue paper "from Monsieur Derozeray's." 
 Emma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his protestations with puns. 
 "Oh," she went on, "I love you! I love you so that I could not live without you, do you see? 
 You are good, you are beautiful, you are clever, you are strong!" 
 He thought all modesty in the way. 
 Hers was an idiotic sort of attachment, full of admiration for him, of voluptuousness for her, a beatitude that benumbed her; her soul sank into this drunkenness, shrivelled up, drowned in it, like Clarence in his butt of Malmsey. 
 Many other things displeased her. 
 First, Charles had not attended to her advice about the forbidding of novels; then the "ways of the house" annoyed her; she allowed herself to make some remarks, and there were quarrels, especially one on account of Felicite. 
 She felt tempted to open the window and call him, but he had already disappeared. 
 Her desires, her sorrows, the experience of pleasure, and her ever-young illusions, that had, as soil and rain and winds and the sun make flowers grow, gradually developed her, and she at length blossomed forth in all the plenitude of her nature. 
 The porcelain night-light threw a round trembling gleam upon the ceiling, and the drawn curtains of the little cot formed as it were a white hut standing out in the shade, and by the bedside Charles looked at them. 
 Then she would have to be sent to the boarding-school; that would cost much; how was it to be done? 
 Then he would buy shares somewhere, no matter where; besides, his practice would increase; he counted upon that, for he wanted Berthe to be well-educated, to be accomplished, to learn to play the piano. 
 Ah! how pretty she would be later on when she was fifteen, when, resembling her mother, she would, like her, wear large straw hats in the summer-time; from a distance they would be taken for two sisters. 
 At last, they would think of her marriage; they would find her some good young fellow with a steady business; he would make her happy; this would last for ever. 
 Often from the top of a mountain there suddenly glimpsed some splendid city with domes, and bridges, and ships, forests of citron trees, and cathedrals of white marble, on whose pointed steeples were storks' nests. 
 They went at a walking-pace because of the great flag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of flowers, offered you by women dressed in red bodices. 
 They heard the chiming of bells, the neighing of mules, together with the murmur of guitars and the noise of fountains, whose rising spray refreshed heaps of fruit arranged like a pyramid at the foot of pale statues that smiled beneath playing waters. 
 And then, one night they came to a fishing village, where brown nets were drying in the wind along the cliffs and in front of the huts. 
 But the child began to cough in her cot or Bovary snored more loudly, and Emma did not fall asleep till morning, when the dawn whitened the windows, and when little Justin was already in the square taking down the shutters of the chemist's shop. 
 As to the cloak"—she seemed to be reflecting—"do not bring it either; you can give me the maker's address, and tell him to have it ready for me." 
 She would take care to send her luggage to Lheureux whence it would be taken direct to the "Hirondelle," so that no one would have any suspicion. 
 I have nothing in the world! you are all to me; so shall I be to you. 
 Then she appeared dazzling with whiteness in the empty heavens that she lit up, and now sailing more slowly along, let fall upon the river a great stain that broke up into an infinity of stars; and the silver sheen seemed to writhe through the very depths like a heedless serpent covered with luminous scales; it also resembled some monster candelabra all along which sparkled drops of diamonds running together. 
 The effect of habits left? Or rather—? 
 Answer me!" 
 "It is at the Hotel de Provence, is it not, that you will wait for me at midday?" 
 "For, after all," he exclaimed, gesticulating, "I can't exile myself—have a child on my hands." 
 First he saw a handkerchief with pale little spots. It was a handkerchief of hers. 
 Near it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature given him by Emma: her toilette seemed to him pretentious, and her languishing look in the worst possible taste. 
 Then, from looking at this image and recalling the memory of its original, Emma's features little by little grew confused in his remembrance, as if the living and the painted face, rubbing one against the other, had effaced each other. 
 Finally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations relating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business notes. 
 "After all, that's true," thought Rodolphe. 
 "I shall not forget you, oh believe it; and I shall ever have a profound devotion for you; but some day, sooner or later, this ardour (such is the fate of human things) would have grown less, no doubt. 
 There ought to have been some tears on this; but I can't cry; it isn't my fault." 
 Then, having emptied some water into a glass, Rodolphe dipped his finger into it, and let a big drop fall on the paper, that made a pale stain on the ink. 
 Then looking for a seal, he came upon the one "Amor nel cor." 
 The next day when he was up (at about two o'clock—he had slept late), Rodolphe had a basket of apricots picked. 
 She could bear it no longer; she ran into the sitting room as if to take the apricots there, overturned the basket, tore away the leaves, found the letter, opened it, and, as if some fearful fire were behind her, Emma flew to her room terrified. 
 Then she tried to calm herself; she recalled the letter; she must finish it; she did not dare to. And where? 
 Emma pushed open the door and went in. 
 Down below, underneath her, the village square was empty; the stones of the pavement glittered, the weathercocks on the houses were motionless. 
 What restrained her? 
 She was free. She advanced, looking at the paving-stones, saying to herself, "Come! come!" 
 The luminous ray that came straight up from below drew the weight of her body towards the abyss. 
 She was right at the edge, almost hanging, surrounded by vast space. 
 The blue of the heavens suffused her, the air was whirling in her hollow head; she had but to yield, to let herself be taken; and the humming of the lathe never ceased, like an angry voice calling her. 
 But she felt such weariness of spirit that she could not even invent a pretext for leaving the table. 
 "What surprises you in that? 
 He absents himself like that from time to time for a change, and, ma foi, I think he's right, when one has a fortune and is a bachelor. 
 Charles, without noticing his wife's colour, had them brought to him, took one, and bit into it. 
 What an odour!" he remarked, passing it under her nose several times. 
 It is nervousness. Sit down and go on eating." 
 For she dreaded lest he should begin questioning her, attending to her, that she should not be left alone. 
 The chemist, at the tumult which broke out in the house ran thither. 
 "I was sure of it," he remarked; "that would wake any dead person for you!" 
 "Speak to us," said Charles; "collect yourself; it is your Charles, who loves you. 
 Charles, standing up, was at the back of the alcove, and the chemist, near him, maintained that meditative silence that is becoming on the serious occasions of life. 
 "Extraordinary!" continued the chemist. 
 Some natures are so sensitive to certain smells; and it would even be a very fine question to study both in its pathological and physiological relation. 
 It is to stupefy the senses and to bring on ecstasies—a thing, moreover, very easy in persons of the weaker sex, who are more delicate than the other. 
 Thus you are not ignorant of the singularly aphrodisiac effect produced by the Nepeta cataria, vulgarly called catmint, on the feline race; and, on the other hand, to quote an example whose authenticity I can answer for. 
 Now she suffered in her heart, then in the chest, the head, the limbs; she had vomitings, in which Charles thought he saw the first signs of cancer. 
 To begin with, he did not know how he could pay Monsieur Homais for all the physic supplied by him, and though, as a medical man, he was not obliged to pay for it, he nevertheless blushed a little at such an obligation. 
 Then the expenses of the household, now that the servant was mistress, became terrible. 
 In fact, at the height of Emma's illness, the latter, taking advantage of the circumstances to make his bill larger, had hurriedly brought the cloak, the travelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other things. It was very well for Charles to say he did not want them. 
 Monsieur Lheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns threatening and whining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a bill at six months. 
 But hardly had he signed this bill than a bold idea occurred to him: it was to borrow a thousand francs from Lheureux. 
 Lheureux ran off to his shop, brought back the money, and dictated another bill, by which Bovary undertook to pay to his order on the 1st of September next the sum of one thousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred and eighty already agreed to, made just twelve hundred and fifty, thus lending at six per cent in addition to one-fourth for commission: and the things bringing him in a good third at the least, this ought in twelve months to give him a profit of a hundred and thirty francs. 
 Then he foresaw such worries that he quickly dismissed so disagreeable a subject of meditation from his mind. 
 When it was fine they wheeled her arm-chair to the window that overlooked the square, for she now had an antipathy to the garden, and the blinds on that side were always down. 
 All her ideas seemed to be limited to the care of herself. 
 She stayed in bed taking little meals, rang for the servant to inquire about her gruel or to chat with her. 
 He inquired after her health, gave her news, exhorted her to religion, in a coaxing little prattle that was not without its charm. 
 The bed-clothes were sprinkled with holy water, the priest drew from the holy pyx the white wafer; and it was fainting with a celestial joy that she put out her lips to accept the body of the Saviour presented to her. 
 This splendid vision dwelt in her memory as the most beautiful thing that it was possible to dream, so that now she strove to recall her sensation. 
 That still lasted, however, but in a less exclusive fashion and with a deeper sweetness. 
 Her soul, tortured by pride, at length found rest in Christian humility, and, tasting the joy of weakness, she saw within herself the destruction of her will, that must have left a wide entrance for the inroads of heavenly grace. 
 She wanted to become a saint. 
 She bought chaplets and wore amulets; she wished to have in her room, by the side of her bed, a reliquary set in emeralds that she might kiss it every evening. 
 But not being much versed in these matters, as soon as they went beyond a certain limit he wrote to Monsieur Boulard, bookseller to Monsignor, to send him "something good for a lady who was very clever." 
 There were the "Think of it; the Man of the World at Mary's Feet, by Monsieur de ***, decorated with many Orders"; "The Errors of Voltaire, for the Use of the Young," etc. 
 Madame Bovary's mind was not yet sufficiently clear to apply herself seriously to anything; moreover, she began this reading in too much hurry. 
 As for the memory of Rodolphe, she had thrust it back to the bottom of her heart, and it remained there more solemn and more motionless than a king's mummy in a catacomb. 
 She sewed clothes for the poor, she sent wood to women in childbed; and Charles one day, on coming home, found three good-for-nothings in the kitchen seated at the table eating soup. 
 She wanted to teach her to read; even when Berthe cried, she was not vexed. 
 These were Madame Langlois, Madame Caron, Madame Dubreuil, Madame Tuvache, and regularly from two to five o'clock the excellent Madame Homais, who, for her part, had never believed any of the tittle-tattle about her neighbour. 
 He went up with them to her bedroom, and remained standing near the door, motionless and mute. 
 Besides, she now enveloped all things with such indifference, she had words so affectionate with looks so haughty, such contradictory ways, that one could no longer distinguish egotism from charity, or corruption from virtue. 
 "So you love him?" she said. 
 They were hot; some sweet cider was brought out, and they drank together to madame's complete restoration. 
 "You must," he said, throwing a satisfied glance all round him, even to the very extremity of the landscape, "hold the bottle perpendicularly on the table, and after the strings are cut, press up the cork with little thrusts, gently, gently, as indeed they do seltzer-water at restaurants." 
 Finally," he added, suddenly assuming a mystic tone of voice while he rolled a pinch of snuff between his fingers, "if the Church has condemned the theatre, she must be right; we must submit to her decrees." 
 Yes, in the middle of the chancel they acted; they performed a kind of farce called 'Mysteries,' which often offended against the laws of decency." 
 The ecclesiastic contented himself with uttering a groan, and the chemist went on— 
 "It's like it is in the Bible; there there are, you know, more than one piquant detail, matters really libidinous!" 
 "I've known priests who put on ordinary clothes to go and see dancers kicking about." 
 I've known some!" And separating the words of his sentence, Homais repeated, "I—have—known—some!" 
 "I only mean to say," he replied in less brutal a tone, "that toleration is the surest way to draw people to religion." 
 From what I hear, he's a regular dog; he's rolling in money; he's taking three mistresses and a cook along with him. 
 "Well, a pleasant journey!" he said to them; "happy mortals that you are!" 
 Then addressing himself to Emma, who was wearing a blue silk gown with four flounces— 
 Madame Bovary bought a bonnet, gloves, and a bouquet. 
 The doctor was much afraid of missing the beginning, and, without having had time to swallow a plate of soup, they presented themselves at the doors of the theatre, which were still closed. 
 The crowd was waiting against the wall, symmetrically enclosed between the balustrades. 
 At the corner of the neighbouring streets huge bills repeated in quaint letters "Lucie de Lammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc." 
 The weather was fine, the people were hot, perspiration trickled amid the curls, and handkerchiefs taken from pockets were mopping red foreheads; and now and then a warm wind that blew from the river gently stirred the border of the tick awnings hanging from the doors of the public-houses. 
 This was an exhalation from the Rue des Charrettes, full of large black warehouses where they made casks. 
 Her heart began to beat as soon as she reached the vestibule. 
 She seemed to hear through the mist the sound of the Scotch bagpipes re-echoing over the heather. 
 Then her remembrance of the novel helping her to understand the libretto, she followed the story phrase by phrase, while vague thoughts that came back to her dispersed at once again with the bursts of music. 
 She was left alone, and the flute was heard like the murmur of a fountain or the warbling of birds. 
 His vigorous form was tightly clad in a brown-coloured doublet; a small chiselled poniard hung against his left thigh, and he cast round laughing looks showing his white teeth. 
 They said that a Polish princess having heard him sing one night on the beach at Biarritz, where he mended boats, had fallen in love with him. 
 She was filling her heart with these melodious lamentations that were drawn out to the accompaniment of the double-basses, like the cries of the drowning in the tumult of a tempest. 
 The voice of a prima donna seemed to her to be but echoes of her conscience, and this illusion that charmed her as some very thing of her own life. 
 He had not wept like Edgar that last moonlit night when they said, "To-morrow! to-morrow!" 
 "But why," asked Bovary, "does that gentleman persecute her?" 
 "Yet he vows vengeance on her family, while the other one who came on before said, 'I love Lucie and she loves me!' 
 Despite Emma's explanations, as soon as the recitative duet began in which Gilbert lays bare his abominable machinations to his master Ashton, Charles, seeing the false troth-ring that is to deceive Lucie, thought it was a love-gift sent by Edgar. 
 Lucie advanced, half supported by her women, a wreath of orange blossoms in her hair, and paler than the white satin of her gown. 
 His large Spanish hat fell at a gesture he made, and immediately the instruments and the singers began the sextet. 
 Edgar, flashing with fury, dominated all the others with his clearer voice; Ashton hurled homicidal provocations at him in deep notes; Lucie uttered her shrill plaint, Arthur at one side, his modulated tones in the middle register, and the bass of the minister pealed forth like an organ, while the voices of the women repeating his words took them up in chorus delightfully. 
 All her small fault-findings faded before the poetry of the part that absorbed her; and, drawn towards this man by the illusion of the character, she tried to imagine to herself his life—that life resonant, extraordinary, splendid, and that might have been hers if fate had willed it. 
 Then each evening, at the back of a box, behind the golden trellis-work she would have drunk in eagerly the expansions of this soul that would have sung for her alone; from the stage, even as he acted, he would have looked at her. 
 She longed to run to his arms, to take refuge in his strength, as in the incarnation of love itself, and to say to him, to cry out, "Take me away! carry me with you! let us go! 
 The smell of the gas mingled with that of the breaths, the waving of the fans, made the air more suffocating. 
 Charles, fearing that she would faint, ran to the refreshment-room to get a glass of barley-water. 
 She had not felt it since that spring evening when the rain fell upon the green leaves, and they had said good-bye standing at the window. 
 But soon recalling herself to the necessities of the situation, with an effort she shook off the torpor of her memories, and began stammering a few hurried words. 
 But from that moment she listened no more; and the chorus of the guests, the scene between Ashton and his servant, the grand duet in D major, all were for her as far off as if the instruments had grown less sonorous and the characters more remote. 
 But the mad scene did not at all interest Emma, and the acting of the singer seemed to her exaggerated. 
 "Yes—a little," he replied, undecided between the frankness of his pleasure and his respect for his wife's opinion. 
 Monsieur Leon put her long lace shawl carefully about her shoulders, and all three went off to sit down in the harbour, in the open air, outside the windows of a cafe. 
 I regret leaving before the end, because it was beginning to amuse me." 
 You are wrong if you feel that this is doing you the least good." 
 Charles, who understood, took out his purse; the clerk held back his arm, and did not forget to leave two more pieces of silver that he made chink on the marble. 
 Night brings counsel." Then to Leon, who was walking along with them, "Now that you are in our part of the world, I hope you'll come and ask us for some dinner now and then." 
 The clerk declared he would not fail to do so, being obliged, moreover, to go to Yonville on some business for his office. 
 Often when he stayed in his room to read, or else when sitting of an evening under the lime-trees of the Luxembourg, he let his Code fall to the ground, and the memory of Emma came back to him. 
 For Leon did not lose all hope; there was for him, as it were, a vague promise floating in the future, like a golden fruit suspended from some fantastic tree. 
 So the next day about five o'clock he walked into the kitchen of the inn, with a choking sensation in his throat, pale cheeks, and that resolution of cowards that stops at nothing. 
 She was not disturbed at his approach; on the contrary, she apologised for having neglected to tell him where they were staying. 
 She began to smile; and at once, to repair his folly, Leon told her that he had spent his morning in looking for her in all the hotels in the town one after the other. 
 The law irritated him, other vocations attracted him, and his mother never ceased worrying him in every one of her letters. 
 Something drove me there continually; I stayed there hours together." Then in a trembling voice, "She resembled you a little." 
 "I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you. 
 I thought I recognised you at street-corners, and I ran after all the carriages through whose windows I saw a shawl fluttering, a veil like yours." 
 "Alas! men have none of these holy missions, and I see nowhere any calling—unless perhaps that of a doctor." 
 What a pity! 
 "Because I loved you so!" And congratulating himself at having surmounted the difficulty, Leon watched her face out of the corner of his eyes. 
 The mass of sad thoughts that darkened them seemed to be lifted from her blue eyes; her whole face shone. 
 "You were downstairs in the ante-room, ready to go out, standing on the last stair; you were wearing a bonnet with small blue flowers; and without any invitation from you, in spite of myself, I went with you. 
 Every moment, however, I grew more and more conscious of my folly, and I went on walking by you, not daring to follow you completely, and unwilling to leave you. 
 When you went into a shop, I waited in the street, and I watched you through the window taking off your gloves and counting the change on the counter. 
 "Yes, it is true—true—true!" 
 Night was darkening over the walls, on which still shone, half hidden in the shade, the coarse colours of four bills representing four scenes from the "Tour de Nesle," with a motto in Spanish and French at the bottom. 
 He from the first moment had loved her, and he despaired when he thought of the happiness that would have been theirs, if thanks to fortune, meeting her earlier, they had been indissolubly bound to one another. 
 And fingering gently the blue binding of her long white sash, he added, "And who prevents us from beginning now?" 
 Was she speaking thus seriously? 
 No doubt Emma did not herself know, quite absorbed as she was by the charm of the seduction, and the necessity of defending herself from it; and contemplating the young man with a moved look, she gently repulsed the timid caresses that his trembling hands attempted. 
 Oh, for pity's sake, let me see you once—only once!" 
 "Will you—" She seemed to reflect; then abruptly, "To-morrow at eleven o'clock in the cathedral." 
 "I shall be there," he cried, seizing her hands, which she disengaged. 
 And as they were both standing up, he behind her, and Emma with her head bent, he stooped over her and pressed long kisses on her neck. 
 "You are mad! Ah! you are mad!" she said, with sounding little laughs, while the kisses multiplied. 
 Then bending his head over her shoulder, he seemed to beg the consent of her eyes. 
 They fell upon him full of an icy dignity. 
 The next morning, at the open window, and humming on his balcony, Leon himself varnished his pumps with several coatings. 
 The nave was reflected in the full fonts with the beginning of the arches and some portions of the glass windows. 
 The church like a huge boudoir spread around her; the arches bent down to gather in the shade the confession of her love; the windows shone resplendent to illumine her face, and the censers would burn that she might appear like an angel amid the fumes of the sweet-smelling odours. 
 He seemed to him to be conducting himself in a monstrous fashion, to be robbing him in a sort, and almost committing sacrilege. 
 The young man was irritated at this bigot fancy; then he nevertheless experienced a certain charm in seeing her, in the middle of a rendezvous, thus lost in her devotions, like an Andalusian marchioness; then he grew bored, for she seemed never coming to an end. 
 Then, in order to proceed "by rule," the beadle conducted them right to the entrance near the square, where, pointing out with his cane a large circle of block-stones without inscription or carving— 
 Leon bit his lips, fuming. 
 It is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?" 
 Madame Bovary put up her eyeglasses. 
 And without stopping, still talking, he pushed them into a chapel full of balustrades, some put away, and disclosed a kind of block that certainly might once have been an ill-made statue. 
 They had buried it for spite in the earth, under the episcopal seat of Monsignor. 
 Leon! Really—I don't know—if I ought," she whispered. 
 "At all events, go out by the north porch," cried the beadle, who was left alone on the threshold, "so as to see the Resurrection, the Last Judgment, Paradise, King David, and the Condemned in Hell-flames." 
 It came back; and then, without any fixed plan or direction, wandered about at hazard. The cab was seen at Saint-Pol, at Lescure, at Mont Gargan, at La Rougue-Marc and Place du Gaillardbois; in the Rue Maladrerie, Rue Dinanderie, before Saint-Romain, Saint-Vivien, Saint-Maclou, Saint-Nicaise—in front of the Customs, at the "Vieille Tour," the "Trois Pipes," and the Monumental Cemetery. 
 And on the harbour, in the midst of the drays and casks, and in the streets, at the corners, the good folk opened large wonder-stricken eyes at this sight, so extraordinary in the provinces, a cab with blinds drawn, and which appeared thus constantly shut more closely than a tomb, and tossing about like a vessel. 
 At about six o'clock the carriage stopped in a back street of the Beauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got out, who walked with her veil down, and without turning her head. 
 At the corner of the streets were small pink heaps that smoked in the air, for this was the time for jam-making, and everyone at Yonville prepared his supply on the same day. 
 But in front of the chemist's shop one might admire a far larger heap, and that surpassed the others with the superiority that a laboratory must have over ordinary stores, a general need over individual fancy. 
 Often I am horrified myself when I think of my responsibility; for the Government persecutes us, and the absurd legislation that rules us is a veritable Damocles' sword over our heads." 
 But you must pull hard at the oar if you're to do that, and get, as, people say, callosities upon your hands. 
 And there you are, dwelling with me snug as a parson, living in clover, taking your ease!" 
 "Oh, dear me!" interrupted the good woman, with a sad air, "how am I to tell you? 
 First he walked up and down with the open volume in his hand, rolling his eyes, choking, tumid, apoplectic. 
 In fact, Monsieur Bovary senior had expired the evening before suddenly from an attack of apoplexy as he got up from table, and by way of greater precaution, on account of Emma's sensibility, Charles had begged Homais to break the horrible news to her gradually. 
 However, he was growing calmer, and was now grumbling in a paternal tone whilst he fanned himself with his skull-cap. 
 Its author was a doctor! There are certain scientific points in it that it is not ill a man should know, and I would even venture to say that a man must know. 
 When Emma knocked at the door. Charles, who was waiting for her, came forward with open arms and said to her with tears in his voice— 
 She only regretted her husband had not received the consolations of religion, as he had died at Daudeville, in the street, at the door of a cafe after a patriotic dinner with some ex-officers. 
 In order to put it down he described painfully a quarter of a circle with his stump. 
 Charles picked up the flowers, and freshening his eyes, red with tears, against them, smelt them delicately. 
 She took them quickly from his hand and put them in a glass of water. 
 The following day they had a talk over the mourning. They went and sat down with their workboxes by the waterside under the arbour. 
 Madame Bovary senior was plying her scissor without looking up, and Charles, in his list slippers and his old brown surtout that he used as a dressing-gown, sat with both hands in his pockets, and did not speak either; near them Berthe, in a little white pinafore, was raking sand in the walks with her spade. 
 Suddenly she saw Monsieur Lheureux, the linendraper, come in through the gate. 
 "I beg your pardon," he said, "but I should like to have a private talk with you." 
 Then in a low voice, "It's about that affair—you know." 
 Charles crimsoned to his ears. "Oh, yes! certainly." 
 And in his confusion, turning to his wife, "Couldn't you, my darling?" 
 She seemed to understand him, for she rose; and Charles said to his mother, "It is nothing particular. 
 As soon as they were alone, Monsieur Lheureux in sufficiently clear terms began to congratulate Emma on the inheritance, then to talk of indifferent matters, of the espaliers, of the harvest, and of his own health, which was always so-so, always having ups and downs. 
 In fact, he had to work devilish hard, although he didn't make enough, in spite of all people said, to find butter for his bread. 
 "And so you're quite well again?" he went on. "Ma foi! 
 The doctor, of course, would do as he pleased; he was not to trouble himself, especially just now, when he would have a lot of worry. 
 "And he would do better to give it over to someone else—to you, for example. 
 With a power of attorney it could be easily managed, and then we (you and I) would have our little business transactions together." 
 It would be necessary to make inquiries, to look into mortgages, and see if there were any occasion for a sale by auction or a liquidation. 
 Perhaps we ought to consult—we only know—no one." 
 The square oars rang in the iron thwarts, and, in the stillness, seemed to mark time, like the beating of a metronome, while at the stern the rudder that trailed behind never ceased its gentle splash against the water. 
 Her musical but weak voice died away along the waves, and the winds carried off the trills that Leon heard pass like the flapping of wings about him. 
 At times the shadow of the willows hid her completely; then she reappeared suddenly, like a vision in the moonlight. 
 There was one especially, a tall handsome man with small moustaches, who was that funny! 
 The adieux were sad. 
 He was to send his letters to Mere Rollet, and she gave him such precise instructions about a double envelope that he admired greatly her amorous astuteness. 
 Leon soon put on an air of superiority before his comrades, avoided their company, and completely neglected his work. 
 He called her to mind with all the strength of his desires and of his memories. Instead of lessening with absence, this longing to see her again grew, so that at last on Saturday morning he escaped from his office. 
 When, from the summit of the hill, he saw in the valley below the church-spire with its tin flag swinging in the wind, he felt that delight mingled with triumphant vanity and egoistic tenderness that millionaires must experience when they come back to their native village. 
 They came back again to embrace once more, and it was then that she promised him to find soon, by no matter what means, a regular opportunity for seeing one another in freedom at least once a week. 
 On the strength of it she bought a pair of yellow curtains with large stripes for her room, whose cheapness Monsieur Lheureux had commended; she dreamed of getting a carpet, and Lheureux, declaring that it wasn't "drinking the sea," politely undertook to supply her with one. 
 It was about this time, that is to say, the beginning of winter, that she seemed seized with great musical fervour. 
 "Yes, so it is—rather," said Charles, giggling stupidly. "But it seems to me that one might be able to do it for less; for there are artists of no reputation, and who are often better than the celebrities." 
 And when anyone came to see her, she did not fail to inform them she had given up music, and could not begin again now for important reasons. 
 When the clock pointed to a quarter past seven, she went off to the "Lion d'Or," whose door Artemise opened yawning. 
 Hivert was leisurely harnessing his horses, listening, moreover, to Mere Lefrancois, who, passing her head and nightcap through a grating, was charging him with commissions and giving him explanations that would have confused anyone else. 
 The "Hirondelle" started at a slow trot, and for about a mile stopped here and there to pick up passengers who waited for it, standing at the border of the road, in front of their yard gates. 
 The four seats, however, filled up. 
 At last the brick houses began to follow one another more closely, the earth resounded beneath the wheels, the "Hirondelle" glided between the gardens, where through an opening one saw statues, a periwinkle plant, clipped yews, and a swing. 
 Sloping down like an amphitheatre, and drowned in the fog, it widened out beyond the bridges confusedly. 
 Then the open country spread away with a monotonous movement till it touched in the distance the vague line of the pale sky. 
 Seen thus from above, the whole landscape looked immovable as a picture; the anchored ships were massed in one corner, the river curved round the foot of the green hills, and the isles, oblique in shape, lay on the water, like large, motionless, black fishes. 
 She poured it out upon the square, on the walks, on the streets, and the old Norman city outspread before her eyes as an enormous capital, as a Babylon into which she was entering. 
 She leant with both hands against the window, drinking in the breeze; the three horses galloped, the stones grated in the mud, the diligence rocked, and Hivert, from afar, hailed the carts on the road, while the bourgeois who had spent the night at the Guillaume woods came quietly down the hill in their little family carriages. 
 Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the shop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at intervals uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She walked with downcast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her lowered black veil. 
 It, is the quarter for theatres, public-houses, and whores. 
 Often a cart would pass near her, bearing some shaking scenery. 
 It all smelt of absinthe, cigars, and oysters. 
 She turned down a street; she recognised him by his curling hair that escaped from beneath his hat. 
 The curtains were in red levantine, that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too much towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing in the world was so lovely as her brown head and white skin standing out against this purple colour, when, with a movement of shame, she crossed her bare arms, hiding her face in her hands. 
 The curtain-rods, ending in arrows, their brass pegs, and the great balls of the fire-dogs shone suddenly when the sun came in. 
 They always found the furniture in the same place, and sometimes hairpins, that she had forgotten the Thursday before, under the pedestal of the clock. 
 Emma carved, put bits on his plate with all sorts of coquettish ways, and she laughed with a sonorous and libertine laugh when the froth of the champagne ran over from the glass to the rings on her fingers. 
 When she sat on his knees, her leg, then too short, hung in the air, and the dainty shoe, that had no back to it, was held only by the toes to her bare foot. 
 By the diversity of her humour, in turn mystical or mirthful, talkative, taciturn, passionate, careless, she awakened in him a thousand desires, called up instincts or memories. 
 He knelt on the ground before her, and with both elbows on her knees looked at her with a smile, his face upturned. 
 And she did not listen for his answer in the haste of her lips that fastened to his mouth. 
 It was hot in the room, small, and too low where the stove was hissing in the midst of wigs and pomades. 
 The smell of the tongs, together with the greasy hands that handled her head, soon stunned her, and she dozed a little in her wrapper. 
 Often, as he did her hair, the man offered her tickets for a masked ball. 
 Then she went away. 
 She sobbed; called on Leon, sent him tender words and kisses lost in the wind. 
 A mass of rags covered his shoulders, and an old staved-in beaver, turned out like a basin, hid his face; but when he took it off he discovered in the place of eyelids empty and bloody orbits. 
 The flesh hung in red shreds, and there flowed from it liquids that congealed into green scale down to the nose, whose black nostrils sniffed convulsively. 
 Charles at home was waiting for her; the "Hirondelle" was always late on Thursdays. 
 There were even days when she had no sooner come in than she went up to her room; and Justin, happening to be there, moved about noiselessly, quicker at helping her than the best of maids. 
 Emma tasted this love in a discreet, absorbed fashion, maintained it by all the artifices of her tenderness, and trembled a little lest it should be lost later on. 
 "Why, like all men," she replied. Then added, repulsing him with a languid movement— 
 Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage? 
 The clerk then felt the lowliness of his position; he longed for epaulettes, crosses, titles. 
 Emma nevertheless concealed many of these extravagant fancies, such as her wish to have a blue tilbury to drive into Rouen, drawn by an English horse and driven by a groom in top-boots. 
 She made him pistachio-creams, and played him waltzes after dinner. 
 So he thought himself the most fortunate of men and Emma was without uneasiness, when, one evening suddenly he said— 
 I spoke to her about you, and she doesn't know you." 
 One morning, when she had gone, as usual, rather lightly clothed, it suddenly began to snow, and as Charles was watching the weather from the window, he caught sight of Monsieur Bournisien in the chaise of Monsieur Tuvache, who was driving him to Rouen. 
 In fact, of the two bills signed by Charles, Emma up to the present had paid only one. As to the second, the shopkeeper, at her request, had consented to replace it by another, which again had been renewed for a long date. 
 Then he drew from his pocket a list of goods not paid for; to wit, the curtains, the carpet, the material for the armchairs, several dresses, and divers articles of dress, the bills for which amounted to about two thousand francs. 
 Then he himself would hand over to madame the remainder after the actual debt was paid. 
 But instead of two thousand francs he brought only eighteen hundred, for the friend Vincart (which was only fair) had deducted two hundred francs for commission and discount. 
 The next morning at daybreak Emma ran to Lheureux to beg him to make out another account for not more than a thousand francs, for to show the one for four thousand it would be necessary to say that she had paid two-thirds, and confess, consequently, the sale of the estate—a negotiation admirably carried out by the shopkeeper, and which, in fact, was only actually known later on. 
 In my time there was a single arm-chair in a house, for elderly persons—at any rate it was so at my mother's, who was a good woman, I can tell you. 
 Everybody can't be rich! 
 I should be ashamed to coddle myself as you do! 
 And yet I am old. 
 What! silk for lining at two francs, when you can get jaconet for ten sous, or even for eight, that would do well enough!" 
 Luckily he had promised to destroy that power of attorney. 
 Emma opened the window, called Charles, and the poor fellow was obliged to confess the promise torn from him by his mother. 
 "Oh, my God!" cried Charles. "Ah! you really are wrong! 
 But Charles, rebelling for the first time, took his wife's part, so that Madame Bovary, senior, said she would leave. 
 Good day—for I am not likely to come soon again, as you say, to make scenes." 
 He even accompanied her to Monsieur Guillaumin to have a second one, just like the other, drawn up. 
 And Charles felt relieved by this comfortable reflection, which gave his weakness the flattering appearance of higher pre-occupation. 
 Happily, Charles remembered his employer's address, and rushed off there. 
 Someone, without opening the door, shouted out the required information, adding a few insults to those who disturb people in the middle of the night. 
 "I was sure of it! I was going there." 
 "Oh, it isn't worth while," said Emma. 
 I do not feel free, you see, if I know that the least delay upsets you like this." 
 This was a sort of permission that she gave herself, so as to get perfect freedom in her escapades. 
 She wanted him to dress all in black, and grow a pointed beard, to look like the portraits of Louis XIII. 
 This was less from vanity than from the one desire of pleasing her. 
 She had tender words and kisses that thrilled his soul. 
 They are jealous of science, and then are opposed to our taking the most legitimate distractions. 
 He was not joking; but vanity getting the better of all prudence, Leon, in spite of himself protested. 
 And all the while he was walking through the streets with him he talked of his wife, his children; of their future, and of his business; told him in what a decayed condition it had formerly been, and to what a degree of perfection he had raised it. 
 Arrived in front of the Hotel de Boulogne, Leon left him abruptly, ran up the stairs, and found his mistress in great excitement. 
 At mention of the chemist she flew into a passion. 
 But she turned away; he drew her back, and, sinking on his knees, clasped her waist with his arms in a languorous pose, full of concupiscence and supplication. 
 But the disparaging of those we love always alienates us from them to some extent. 
 Yet there was upon that brow covered with cold drops, on those quivering lips, in those wild eyes, in the strain of those arms, something vague and dreary that seemed to Leon to glide between them subtly as if to separate them. 
 She did not fail, in truth, to lavish all sorts of attentions upon him, from the delicacies of food to the coquettries of dress and languishing looks. 
 She brought roses to her breast from Yonville, which she threw into his face; was anxious about his health, gave him advice as to his conduct; and, in order the more surely to keep her hold on him, hoping perhaps that heaven would take her part, she tied a medal of the Virgin round his neck. 
 She said to him— 
 She would have liked to be able to watch over his life; and the idea occurred to her of having him followed in the streets. 
 One day, when they had parted early and she was returning alone along the boulevard, she saw the walls of her convent; then she sat down on a form in the shade of the elm-trees. 
 The first month of her marriage, her rides in the wood, the viscount that waltzed, and Lagardy singing, all repassed before her eyes. 
 Whence came this insufficiency in life—this instantaneous turning to decay of everything on which she leant? 
 But if there were somewhere a being strong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement, a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find him? 
 Every smile hid a yawn of boredom, every joy a curse, all pleasure satiety, and the sweetest kisses left upon your lips only the unattainable desire for a greater delight. 
 He took out the pins that held together the side-pockets of his long green overcoat, stuck them into his sleeve, and politely handed her a paper. 
 It was a bill for seven hundred francs, signed by her, and which Lheureux, in spite of all his professions, had paid away to Vincart. She sent her servant for him. 
 "Oh," said Emma, "tell him that I haven't it. 
 But the next day at twelve o'clock she received a summons, and the sight of the stamped paper, on which appeared several times in large letters, "Maitre Hareng, bailiff at Buchy," so frightened her that she rushed in hot haste to the linendraper's. 
 She found him in his shop, doing up a parcel. 
 Emma kept down a desire to strike him, and asked gently if there was no way of quieting Monsieur Vincart. 
 I'll have nothing more to do with it." 
 She wept; she even called him "her good Monsieur Lheureux." 
 Besides, he hadn't a brass farthing; no one was paying him now-a-days; they were eating his coat off his back; a poor shopkeeper like him couldn't advance money. 
 Emma was silent, and Monsieur Lheureux, who was biting the feathers of a quill, no doubt became uneasy at her silence, for he went on— 
 "Provided that Vincart will listen to me! 
 Next he carelessly showed her several new goods, not one of which, however, was in his opinion worthy of madame. 
 "When I think that there's a dress at threepence-halfpenny a yard, and warranted fast colours! 
 The mother-in-law replied that she had nothing more, the winding up was over, and there was due to them besides Barneville an income of six hundred francs, that she would pay them punctually. 
 To get money she began selling her old gloves, her old hats, the old odds and ends, and she bargained rapaciously, her peasant blood standing her in good stead. 
 She renewed the bills, and thus it was continually. 
 Sometimes, it is true, she tried to make a calculation, but she discovered things so exorbitant that she could not believe them possible. 
 What was the meaning of all these fits of temper? 
 She stayed there all day long, torpid, half dressed, and from time to time burning Turkish pastilles which she had bought at Rouen in an Algerian's shop. 
 Or at other times, consumed more ardently than ever by that inner flame to which adultery added fuel, panting, tremulous, all desire, she threw open her window, breathed in the cold air, shook loose in the wind her masses of hair, too heavy, and, gazing upon the stars, longed for some princely love. She thought of him, of Leon. 
 One day she drew six small silver-gilt spoons from her bag (they were old Roualt's wedding present), begging him to pawn them at once for her, and Leon obeyed, though the proceeding annoyed him. He was afraid of compromising himself. 
 Then, though she might feel humiliated at the baseness of such enjoyment, she clung to it from habit or from corruption, and each day she hungered after them the more, exhausting all felicity in wishing for too much of it. 
 He dwelt in that azure land where silk ladders hang from balconies under the breath of flowers, in the light of the moon. She felt him near her; he was coming, and would carry her right away in a kiss. 
 Often she even received summonses, stamped paper that she barely looked at. She would have liked not to be alive, or to be always asleep. 
 They caught sight of one on the harbour, a very indifferent restaurant, whose proprietor showed them to a little room on the fourth floor. 
 There were a clerk, two medical students, and a shopman—what company for her! 
 Day was breaking, and a great stain of purple colour broadened out in the pale horizon over the St. Catherine hills. The livid river was shivering in the wind; there was no one on the bridges; the street lamps were going out. 
 Then a cart filled with long strips of iron passed by, and made a deafening metallic vibration against the walls of the houses. 
 She wished that, taking wing like a bird, she could fly somewhere, far away to regions of purity, and there grow young again. 
 She went out, crossed the Boulevard, the Place Cauchoise, and the Faubourg, as far as an open street that overlooked some gardens. 
 She walked rapidly; the fresh air calming her; and, little by little, the faces of the crowd, the masks, the quadrilles, the lights, the supper, those women, all disappeared like mists fading away. 
 What judgment? As a matter of fact, the evening before another paper had been brought that she had not yet seen, and she was stunned by these words— 
 Lheureux, she thought, wanted to frighten her again; for she saw through all his devices, the object of his kindnesses. 
 And Lheureux drew from his strong box the receipt for eighteen hundred francs that she had given him when Vincart had discounted the bills. 
 I'll show him!" Then he approached her, and in a soft voice said— 
 "There! tears now!" 
 "Charming! very pretty." Then he began writing again, dipping his pen into the horn inkstand in his left hand. 
 Once the man, no doubt bored in his hiding-place, made a slight noise. 
 All the greater reason to try and do something; it was impossible that they could not find three thousand francs. 
 "Go, try, try! I will love you so!" 
 He went out, and came back at the end of an hour, saying, with solemn face— 
 Then he was afraid, and to avoid any explanation he smote his forehead, crying— 
 It was one of those March days, clear and sharp, when the sun shines in a perfectly white sky. 
 She reached the Place du Parvis. People were coming out after vespers; the crowd flowed out through the three doors like a stream through the three arches of a bridge, and in the middle one, more motionless than a rock, stood the beadle. 
 "Take care!" cried a voice issuing from the gate of a courtyard that was thrown open. 
 She stopped to let pass a black horse, pawing the ground between the shafts of a tilbury, driven by a gentleman in sable furs. Who was it? 
 Then she thought she had been mistaken. 
 Anyhow, she did not know. 
 Madame Homais was very fond of these small, heavy turban-shaped loaves, that are eaten in Lent with salt butter; a last vestige of Gothic food that goes back, perhaps, to the time of the Crusades, and with which the robust Normans gorged themselves of yore, fancying they saw on the table, in the light of the yellow torches, between tankards of hippocras and huge boars' heads, the heads of Saracens to be devoured. 
 "Charmed to see you," he said, offering Emma a hand to help her into the "Hirondelle." Then he hung up his cheminots to the cords of the netting, and remained bare-headed in an attitude pensive and Napoleonic. 
 But when the blind man appeared as usual at the foot of the hill he exclaimed— 
 The blind man held out his hat, that flapped about at the door, as if it were a bag in the lining that had come unnailed. 
 Instead of getting drunk at the public, you'd do better to die yourself." 
 He advised him to take good wine, good beer, and good joints. 
 The blind man went on with his song; he seemed, moreover, almost idiotic. 
 And this question meant to say— 
 The sky was sombre, and a little snow was falling. 
 At the sound of the bell, Theodore in a red waistcoat appeared on the steps; he came to open the door almost familiarly, as to an acquaintance, and showed her into the dining-room. 
 The ready-laid table, the two silver chafing-dishes, the crystal door-knobs, the parquet and the furniture, all shone with a scrupulous, English cleanliness; the windows were ornamented at each corner with stained glass. 
 Eating his cutlet and drinking his tea, he buried his chin in his sky-blue cravat, into which were thrust two diamond pins, held together by a small gold chain; and he smiled a singular smile, in a sugary, ambiguous fashion. 
 They might, either in the turf-peats of Grumesnil or building-ground at Havre, almost without risk, have ventured on some excellent speculations; and he let her consume herself with rage at the thought of the fabulous sums that she would certainly have made. 
 He held out his hand, took hers, covered it with a greedy kiss, then held it on his knee; and he played delicately with her fingers whilst he murmured a thousand blandishments. 
 His insipid voice murmured like a running brook; a light shone in his eyes through the glimmering of his spectacles, and his hand was advancing up Emma's sleeve to press her arm. She felt against her cheek his panting breath. 
 And for a quarter of an hour the two of them went over the various persons in Yonville who might perhaps be inclined to help her. 
 To write to her father—it was too late; and perhaps, she began to repent now that she had not yielded to that other, when she heard the trot of a horse in the alley. 
 It was he; he was opening the gate; he was whiter than the plaster wall. 
 Rushing to the stairs, she ran out quickly to the square; and the wife of the mayor, who was talking to Lestiboudois in front of the church, saw her go in to the tax-collector's. 
 At last these ladies thought they made out the word "francs," and Madame Tuvache whispered in a low voice— 
 They saw her walking up and down, examining the napkin-rings, the candlesticks, the banister rails against the walls, while Binet stroked his beard with satisfaction. 
 And no doubt she was suggesting something abominable to him; for the tax-collector—yet he was brave, had fought at Bautzen and at Lutzen, had been through the French campaign, and had even been recommended for the cross—suddenly, as at the sight of a serpent, recoiled as far as he could from her, crying— 
 She looked at the scales on the walls, two brands smoking end to end, and a long spider crawling over her head in a rent in the beam. 
 At last she began to collect her thoughts. 
 She gasped as she turned her eyes about her, while the peasant woman, frightened at her face, drew back instinctively, thinking her mad. 
 Suddenly she struck her brow and uttered a cry; for the thought of Rodolphe, like a flash of lightning in a dark night, had passed into her soul. 
 And besides, should he hesitate to do her this service, she would know well enough how to constrain him to it by re-waking, in a single moment, their lost love. 
 The dogs in their kennels all barked, and the noise of their voices resounded, but brought out no one. 
 "Oh," she replied bitterly, "they are poor charms since you disdained them." 
 He had drawn her upon his knees, and with the back of his hand was caressing her smooth hair, where in the twilight was mirrored like a golden arrow one last ray of the sun. 
 She bent down her brow; at last he kissed her on the eyelids quite gently with the tips of his lips. 
 You have a chateau, farms, woods; you go hunting; you travel to Paris. 
 Why, if it were but that," she cried, taking up two studs from the mantelpiece, "but the least of these trifles, one can get money for them. 
 She saw her father, Lheureux's closet, their room at home, another landscape. 
 Madness was coming upon her; she grew afraid, and managed to recover herself, in a confused way, it is true, for she did not in the least remember the cause of the terrible condition she was in, that is to say, the question of money. 
 Suddenly it seemed to her that fiery spheres were exploding in the air like fulminating balls when they strike, and were whirling, whirling, to melt at last upon the snow between the branches of the trees. 
 She was about to enter, but at the sound of the bell someone might come, and slipping in by the gate, holding her breath, feeling her way along the walls, she went as far as the door of the kitchen, where a candle stuck on the stove was burning. 
 Justin in his shirt-sleeves was carrying out a dish. 
 "Justin!" called the druggist impatiently. 
 He sent Felicite to Homais, to Monsieur Tuvache, to Lheureux, to the "Lion d'Or," everywhere, and in the intervals of his agony he saw his reputation destroyed, their fortune lost, Berthe's future ruined. 
 She had come back. 
 She drank a mouthful of water and turned to the wall. The frightful taste of ink continued. 
 "I am thirsty; oh! so thirsty," she sighed. 
 She turned her head from side to side with a gentle movement full of agony, while constantly opening her mouth as if something very heavy were weighing upon her tongue. 
 Charles noticed that at the bottom of the basin there was a sort of white sediment sticking to the sides of the porcelain. 
 Her shoulders were shaken by a strong shuddering, and she was growing paler than the sheets in which her clenched fingers buried themselves. 
 He flew to the writing-table, tore open the seal, and read aloud: "Accuse no one." He stopped, passed his hands across his eyes, and read it over again. 
 And he could think of nothing; he did not know, he did not dare; the urgent need for some immediate resolution gave the finishing stroke to the turmoil of his mind. 
 So she had done, she thought, with all the treachery; and meanness, and numberless desires that had tortured her. 
 She hated no one now; a twilight dimness was settling upon her thoughts, and, of all earthly noises, Emma heard none but the intermittent lamentations of this poor heart, sweet and indistinct like the echo of a symphony dying away. 
 He belonged to that great school of surgery begotten of Bichat, to that generation, now extinct, of philosophical practitioners, who, loving their art with a fanatical love, exercised it with enthusiasm and wisdom. 
 Charles caught him in both his arms, and gazed at him wildly, imploringly, half-fainting against his breast. 
 He could not by temperament keep away from celebrities, so he begged Monsieur Lariviere to do him the signal honour of accepting some breakfast. 
 He sent quickly to the "Lion d'Or" for some pigeons; to the butcher's for all the cutlets that were to be had; to Tuvache for cream; and to Lestiboudois for eggs; and the druggist himself aided in the preparations, while Madame Homais was saying as she pulled together the strings of her jacket— 
 "I wished, doctor, to make an analysis, and primo I delicately introduced a tube—" 
 "I have even read that various persons have found themselves under toxicological symptoms, and, as it were, thunderstricken by black-pudding that had been subjected to a too vehement fumigation. 
 Madame Homais reappeared, carrying one of those shaky machines that are heated with spirits of wine; for Homais liked to make his coffee at table, having, moreover, torrefied it, pulverised it, and mixed it himself. 
 The priest rose to take the crucifix; then she stretched forward her neck as one who is athirst, and glueing her lips to the body of the Man-God, she pressed upon it with all her expiring strength the fullest kiss of love that she had ever given. 
 Finishing his exhortations, he tried to place in her hand a blessed candle, symbol of the celestial glory with which she was soon to be surrounded. 
 Her chest soon began panting rapidly; the whole of her tongue protruded from her mouth; her eyes, as they rolled, grew paler, like the two globes of a lamp that is going out, so that one might have thought her already dead but for the fearful labouring of her ribs, shaken by violent breathing, as if the soul were struggling to free itself. 
 Felicite knelt down before the crucifix, and the druggist himself slightly bent his knees, while Monsieur Canivet looked out vaguely at the Place. 
 Emma raised herself like a galvanised corpse, her hair undone, her eyes fixed, staring. 
 Weaker than a child, Charles let himself be led downstairs into the sitting-room, and Monsieur Homais soon went home. 
 Homais did not dare to speak to him again about the funeral arrangements; it was the priest who succeeded in reconciling him to them. 
 God was very great, was very good: one must submit to his decrees without a murmur; nay, must even thank him. 
 Bovary was far away. 
 He was walking with great strides along by the wall, near the espalier, and he ground his teeth; he raised to heaven looks of malediction, but not so much as a leaf stirred. 
 At six o'clock a noise like a clatter of old iron was heard on the Place; it was the "Hirondelle" coming in, and he remained with his forehead against the windowpane, watching all the passengers get out, one after the other. 
 He threw himself upon it and fell asleep. 
 So bearing no grudge to poor Charles, he came back again in the evening to sit up with the body; bringing with him three volumes and a pocket-book for taking notes. 
 He recalled stories of catalepsy, the marvels of magnetism, and he said to himself that by willing it with all his force he might perhaps succeed in reviving her. Once he even bent towards he, and cried in a low voice, "Emma! 
 Emma!" His strong breathing made the flames of the candles tremble against the wall. 
 He became so angry that she was silent, and he even commissioned her to go to town at once and buy what was necessary. 
 He rose, pressed their hands, unable to speak. Then they sat down near one another, and formed a large semicircle in front of the fire. 
 He also carried a large jar full of chlorine water, to keep off all miasmata. Just then the servant, Madame Lefrancois, and Madame Bovary senior were busy about Emma, finishing dressing her, and they were drawing down the long stiff veil that covered her to her satin shoes. 
 "But, good heaven!" cried the ecclesiastic, "how do you expect an individual who is married to keep the secrets of the confessional, for example?" 
 "They smell the dead," replied the priest. 
 The aromatic herbs were still smoking, and spirals of bluish vapour blended at the window-sash with the fog that was coming in. 
 He again heard the laughter of the happy boys beneath the apple-trees: the room was filled with the perfume of her hair; and her dress rustled in his arms with a noise like electricity. 
 Slowly, with the tips of his fingers, palpitating, he lifted her veil. 
 They dragged him down into the sitting-room. Then Felicite came up to say that he wanted some of her hair. 
 Felicite had taken care to put on the chest of drawers, for each of them, a bottle of brandy, some cheese, and a large roll. 
 At last, when the three lids had been planed down, nailed, soldered, it was placed outside in front of the door; the house was thrown open, and the people of Yonville began to flock round. 
 At last, he had put on his blouse, taken his hat, fastened his spurs to his boots, and set out at full speed; and the whole of the way old Rouault, panting, was torn by anguish. 
 He said to himself that no doubt they would save her; the doctors would discover some remedy surely. He remembered all the miraculous cures he had been told about. 
 At last he began to think it was all a joke; someone's spite, the jest of some wag; and besides, if she were dead, one would have known it. But no! 
 And seated in a stall of the choir, side by side, they saw pass and repass in front of them continually the three chanting choristers. 
 Lestiboudois went about the church with his whalebone stick. 
 Yet he tried to stir himself to a feeling of devotion, to throw himself into the hope of a future life in which he should see her again. 
 There was a great moving of chairs; the bearers slipped their three staves under the coffin, and everyone left the church. 
 All sorts of joyous sounds filled the air; the jolting of a cart rolling afar off in the ruts, the crowing of a cock, repeated again and again, or the gambling of a foal running away under the apple-trees: The pure sky was fretted with rosy clouds; a bluish haze rested upon the cots covered with iris. 
 He remembered mornings like this, when, after visiting some patient, he came out from one and returned to her. 
 "I haven't had leisure," said Homais, "to prepare a few words that I would have cast upon her tomb." 
 It was a new one, and as he had often during the journey wiped his eyes on the sleeves, the dye had stained his face, and the traces of tears made lines in the layer of dust that covered it. 
 I thought of something to say then, but now—" Then, with a loud groan that shook his whole chest, "Ah! this is the end for me, do you see! 
 But when he reached the top of the hill he turned back, as he had turned once before on the road of Saint-Victor when he had parted from her. 
 He put his hand over his eyes, and saw in the horizon an enclosure of walls, where trees here and there formed black clusters between white stones; then he went on his way at a gentle trot, for his nag had gone lame. 
 Despite their fatigue, Charles and his mother stayed very long that evening talking together. 
 Midnight struck. 
 What did this mean? He remembered Rodolphe's attentions, his sudden, disappearance, his constrained air when they had met two or three times since. 
 To please her, as if she were still living, he adopted her predilections, her ideas; he bought patent leather boots and took to wearing white cravats. He put cosmetics on his moustache, and, like her, signed notes of hand. 
 This success emboldened him, and henceforth there was no longer a dog run over, a barn burnt down, a woman beaten in the parish, of which he did not immediately inform the public, guided always by the love of progress and the hate of priests. 
 Homais was digging and delving; he was becoming dangerous. 
 However, he was stifling in the narrow limits of journalism, and soon a book, a work was necessary to him. 
 He busied himself with great questions: the social problem, moralisation of the poorer classes, pisciculture, caoutchouc, railways, etc. He even began to blush at being a bourgeois. 
 He by no means gave up his shop. 
 He was enthusiastic about the hydro-electric Pulvermacher chains; he wore one himself, and when at night he took off his flannel vest, Madame Homais stood quite dazzled before the golden spiral beneath which he was hidden, and felt her ardour redouble for this man more bandaged than a Scythian, and splendid as one of the Magi. 
 And in all his plans Homais always stuck to the weeping willow, which he looked upon as the indispensable symbol of sorrow. 
 Yet every night he dreamt of her; it was always the same dream. 
 Then he appealed to his mother, who consented to let him take a mortgage on her property, but with a great many recriminations against Emma; and in return for her sacrifice she asked for a shawl that had escaped the depredations of Felicite. 
 As his affections vanished, he clung more closely to the love of his child. 
 Homais hankered after the cross of the Legion of Honour. He had plenty of claims to it. 
 At last, unable to bear it any longer, he had a grass plot in his garden designed to represent the Star of the Cross of Honour with two little strips of grass running from the top to imitate the ribband. 
 Sometimes, however, some curious person climbed on to the garden hedge, and saw with amazement this long-bearded, shabbily clothed, wild man, who wept aloud as he walked up and down. 
 In the evening in summer he took his little girl with him and led her to the cemetery. 
 The voluptuousness of his grief was, however, incomplete, for he had no one near him to share it, and he paid visits to Madame Lefrancois to be able to speak of her. 
 For Lheureux had at last established the "Favorites du Commerce," and Hivert, who enjoyed a great reputation for doing errands, insisted on a rise of wages, and was threatening to go over "to the opposition shop." 
 The other went on talking agriculture, cattle, pasturage, filling out with banal phrases all the gaps where an allusion might slip in. 
 This gradually grew redder; the nostrils throbbed fast, the lips quivered. 
 There was at last a moment when Charles, full of a sombre fury, fixed his eyes on Rodolphe, who, in something of fear, stopped talking. 
 Rays of light were straying through the trellis, the vine leaves threw their shadows on the sand, the jasmines perfumed the air, the heavens were blue, Spanish flies buzzed round the lilies in bloom, and Charles was suffocating like a youth beneath the vague love influences that filled his aching heart. 
 Since Bovary's death three doctors have followed one another at Yonville without any success, so severely did Homais attack them. 
 A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Notre−Dame, the author of this book found, in an obscure nook of one of the towers, the following word, engraved by hand upon the wall:−− 
 For it is thus that people have been in the habit of proceeding with the marvellous churches of the Middle Ages for the last two hundred years. 
 The man who wrote that word upon the wall disappeared from the midst of the generations of man many centuries ago; the word, in its turn, has been effaced from the wall of the church; the church will, perhaps, itself soon disappear from the face of the earth. 
 On that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Grève, a maypole at the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice. 
 It had been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the cross roads, by the provost's men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts. 
 Each had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another, the mystery play. 
 The populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days previously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery, and at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place in the grand hall. 
 It was no easy matter on that day, to force one's way into that grand hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of the Château of Montargis). 
 With the reader's consent, we will endeavor to retrace in thought, the impression which he would have experienced in company with us on crossing the threshold of that grand hall, in the midst of that tumultuous crowd in surcoats, short, sleeveless jackets, and doublets. 
 A ladder, naively placed on the outside, was to serve as means of communication between the dressing−room and the stage, and lend its rude rungs to entrances as well as to exits. 
 Four of the bailiff of the palace's sergeants, perfunctory guardians of all the pleasures of the people, on days of festival as well as on days of execution, stood at the four corners of the marble table. 
 It was very late, no doubt, for a theatrical representation, but they had been obliged to fix the hour to suit the convenience of the ambassadors. 
 A goodly number of curious, good people had been shivering since daybreak before the grand staircase of the palace; some even affirmed that they had passed the night across the threshold of the great door, in order to make sure that they should be the first to pass in. 
 A thousand ~livres parisi~ for a mass! and out of the tax on sea fish in the markets of Paris, to boot!" 
 A shout of laughter from all the students greeted the unlucky name of the poor furrier of the king's robes. 
 However, there is a maypole and a bonfire in the town; a mystery, Pope of the Fools, and Flemish ambassadors in the city; and, at the university, nothing!" 
 "Is it really our venerable rector, Master Thibaut?" demanded Jehan Frollo du Moulin, who, as he was clinging to one of the inner pillars, could not see what was going on outside. 
 The rector, who was walking at the head of his company, had to support the first broadside; it was severe. 
 * ~Thibaut au des~,−−Thibaut of the dice. The entire band repeated this quip in a voice of thunder, clapping their hands furiously. 
 "You are going to seek a lodging in the Rue Thibautodé, are you not, monsieur le recteur, gamester on the side of the devil?" 
 Meanwhile, the sworn bookseller of the university, Master Andry Musnier, was inclining his ear to the furrier of the king's robes, Master Gilles Lecornu. 
 It is the accursed inventions of this century that are ruining everything,−−artilleries, bombards, and, above all, printing, that other German pest. 
 The personage, but little reassured, and trembling in every limb, advanced to the edge of the marble table with a vast amount of bows, which, in proportion as he drew nearer, more and more resembled genuflections. 
 "Begin at once," went on the other. "Satisfy the populace; I undertake to appease the bailiff, who will appease monsieur the cardinal." 
 "That which is suitable for a legate," returned the stranger, with a good deal of dryness, "is not suitable for a princess." 
 On recovering from his first stupefaction, he bestirred himself to shout, to the four personages on the stage, "Go on! What the devil!−−go on!" −−without even deigning to cast a glance of disdain upon the two interrupters. 
 At that moment, he felt some one pluck at the hem of his surtout; he turned round, and not without ill−humor, and found considerable difficulty in smiling; but he was obliged to do so, nevertheless. 
 In the meantime, the actors had obeyed his injunction, and the public, seeing that they were beginning to speak again, began once more to listen, not without having lost many beauties in the sort of soldered joint which was formed between the two portions of the piece thus abruptly cut short. 
 In forest ne'er was seen a more triumphant beast; the door of the reserved gallery which had hitherto remained so inopportunely closed, opened still more inopportunely; and the ringing voice of the usher announced abruptly, "His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon." 
 A rare, precious, and never interrupted race of philosophers to whom wisdom, like another Ariadne, seems to have given a clew of thread which they have been walking along unwinding since the beginning of the world, through the labyrinth of human affairs. 
 While he was sending a rather indifferent glance around the audience, the tumult redoubled. Each person wished to get a better view of him. 
 Now, the dominating trait, the peculiar and distinctive trait of the character of the Primate of the Gauls, was the spirit of the courtier, and devotion to the powers that be. 
 This was their day, their feast of fools, their saturnalia, the annual orgy of the corporation of Law clerks and of the school. 
 Was it not the least that one could do to swear at one's ease and revile the name of God a little, on so fine a day, in such good company as dignitaries of the church and loose women? 
 While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull−dog by the side of a fox. 
 For two days his eminence had been exerting his utmost efforts to lick these Flemish bears into shape, and to render them a little more presentable to the public, and this freak was startling. 
 "The devil!" said Joannes de Molendino, "what are they jabbering down yonder, at the end of the hall?" (for Gringoire was making noise enough for four.) 
 The bailiff of the courts was a sort of amphibious magistrate, a sort of bat of the judicial order, related to both the rat and the bird, the judge and the soldier. 
 Let the reader imagine the effect in the midst of a theatrical piece, of the yelping of an usher, flinging in between two rhymes, and often in the middle of a line, parentheses like the following,−− 
 "Master Dreux−Raguier, surveyor of the woods and forests of the king our sovereign, in the land of France, Champagne and Brie!" 
 With what bitterness did he behold his whole erection of glory and of poetry crumble away bit by bit! 
 But this is the way we manage it; we collect a crowd like this one here, then each personin turn passes his head through a hole, and makes a grimace at the rest; time one who makes the ugliest, is elected pope by general acclamation; that's the way it is. 
 In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion. 
 The attention of the populace, like the sun, pursued its revolution; having set out from one end of the hall, and halted for a space in the middle, it had now reached the other end. 
 There were no longer either scholars or ambassadors or bourgeois or men or women; there was no longer any Clopin Trouillefou, nor Gilles Lecornu, nor Marie Quatrelivres, nor Robin Poussepain. 
 The strange visages which came, in turn, to gnash their teeth in the rose window, were like so many brands cast into the brazier; and from the whole of this effervescing crowd, there escaped, as from a furnace, a sharp, piercing, stinging noise, hissing like the wings of a gnat. 
 In the midst of this witches' sabbath, he was still to be seen on the top of his pillar, like the cabin−boy on the topmast. 
 We shall see which will carry the day, grimaces or polite literature." 
 It was far worse than it had been a little while before. 
 "You are a rogue with whom I have a fancy for carousing, were it to cost me a new dozen of twelve livres of Tours. How does it strike you?" 
 "What a devil of a man!" said Robin Poussepain still all bruised with his fall. "He shows himself; he's a hunchback. 
 In the meantime, all the beggars, all the lackeys, all the cutpurses, joined with the scholars, had gone in procession to seek, in the cupboard of the law clerks' company, the cardboard tiara, and the derisive robe of the Pope of the Fools. 
 He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public. 
 This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar. The throng rushed eagerly after them. 
 "Good," he said to himself, "there go all the mischief− makers." Unfortunately, all the mischief−makers constituted the entire audience. 
 "A fine rabble of asses and dolts these Parisians!" he muttered between his teeth; "they come to hear a mystery and don't listen to it at all! 
 They are engrossed by every one, by Chopin Trouillefou, by the cardinal, by Coppenole, by Quasimodo, by the devil! but by Madame the Virgin Mary, not at all. 
 This gloom pleased him; he was in haste to reach some obscure and deserted alley, in order there to meditate at his ease, and in order that the philosopher might place the first dressing upon the wound of the poet. 
 At the end of a few moments his foot came in contact with an obstacle; he stumbled and fell. 
 It was the May truss, which the clerks of the clerks' law court had deposited that morning at the door of a president of the parliament, in honor of the solemnity of the day. 
 One could divine by the ray of a tiny light the sort of hut in the form of a beehive where the ferryman of cows took refuge at night. 
 For the bourgeois of Paris were aware that it is not sufficient to pray in every conjuncture, and to plead for the franchises of the city, and they had always in reserve, in the garret of the town hall, a few good rusty arquebuses. 
 "In truth," said Gringoire to himself, "she is a salamander, she is a nymph, she is a goddess, she is a bacchante of the Menelean Mount!" 
 At that moment, one of the salamander's braids of hair became unfastened, and a piece of yellow copper which was attached to it, rolled to the ground. 
 Djali reared himself on his hind legs, and began to bleat, marching along with so much dainty gravity, that the entire circle of spectators burst into a laugh at this parody of the interested devoutness of the captain of pistoliers. 
 And the crowd applauded louder than ever. 
 "Ah!" said she, "'tis that villanous man!" Then, thrusting her under lip out beyond the upper, she made a little pout, which appeared to be familiar to her, executed a pirouette on her heel, and set about collecting in her tambourine the gifts of the multitude. 
 In the meantime, the pretty girl stood there, gazing at him with her big eyes, and holding out her tambourine to him and waiting. Gringoire broke into a violent perspiration. 
 There were continual outbursts, melodies, unexpected cadences, then simple phrases strewn with aerial and hissing notes; then floods of scales which would have put a nightingale to rout, but in which harmony was always present; then soft modulations of octaves which rose and fell, like the bosom of the young singer. 
 The words which she sang were in a tongue unknown to Gringoire, and which seemed to him to be unknown to herself, so little relation did the expression which she imparted to her song bear to the sense of the words. 
 This procession, which our readers have seen set out from the Palais de Justice, had organized on the way, and had been recruited by all the knaves, idle thieves, and unemployed vagabonds in Paris; so that it presented a very respectable aspect when it arrived at the Grève. 
 Then came the Kingdom of Argot; that is to say, all the thieves of France, arranged according to the order of their dignity; the minor people walking first. 
 In the centre of the conclave of the passed masters of pickpockets, one had some difficulty in distinguishing the King of Argot, the grand coësre, so called, crouching in a little cart drawn by two big dogs. 
 But it was around the Pope of the Fools that all the musical riches of the epoch were displayedin a magnificent discord. It was nothing but soprano rebecs, counter−tenor rebecs, and tenor rebecs, not to reckon the flutes and brass instruments. 
 It is difficult to convey an idea of the degree of proud and blissful expansion to which the sad and hideous visage of Quasimodo had attained during the transit from the Palais de Justice, to the Place de Grève. 
 Moreover, for the purpose of thus following passers−by (and especially female passers−by) in the streets, which Gringoire was fond of doing, there is no better disposition than ignorance of where one is going to sleep. 
 So he walked along, very thoughtfully, behind the young girl, who hastened her pace and made her goat trot as she saw the bourgeois returning home and the taverns−−the only shops which had been open that day−−closing. 
 And in the points of suspense which he placed after this reticence in his mind, there lay I know not what flattering ideas. 
 "Do you know that it is cold, Master Thibaut Fernicle?" (Gringoire had been aware of this since the beginning of the winter.) 
 Nevertheless, a twist of tow soaked in oil, which burned in a cage at the feet of the Holy Virgin at the street corner, permitted Gringoire to make out the gypsy struggling in the arms of two men, who were endeavoring to stifle her cries. 
 Each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from Gringoire's loins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion. 
 Then he retraced his steps, and feeling his way and searching, with his nose to the wind and his ears on the alert, he tried to find the blessed pallet again, but in vain. 
 There was nothing to be found but intersections of houses, closed courts, and crossings of streets, in the midst of which he hesitated and doubted incessantly, being more perplexed and entangled in this medley of streets than he would have been even in the labyrinth of the Hôtel des Tournelles. 
 This exclamation afforded him a little solace, and a sort of reddish reflection which he caught sight of at that moment, at the extremity of a long and narrow lane, completed the elevation of his moral tone. "God be praised!" said he, "There it is yonder! 
 Nothing renders one so adventurous as not being able to feel the place where one's pocket is situated. 
 At the moment when he passed close to this species of spider with a human countenance, it raised towards him a lamentable voice: "~La buona mancia, signor! la buona mancia~!"* 
 It was an impotent man, both halt and crippled, and halt and crippled to such a degree that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which sustained him, gave him the air of a mason's scaffolding on the march. 
 This living tripod saluted him as he passed, but stopping his hat on a level with Gringoire's chin, like a shaving dish, while he shouted in the latter's ears: Give me the means to buy a bit of bread, sir. 
 "It appears," said Gringoire, "that this one can also talk; but 'tis a rude language, and he is more fortunate than I if he understands it." Then, smiting his brow, in a sudden transition of ideas: 
 "By the way, what the deuce did they mean this morning with their Esmeralda?" 
 This something or, rather, some one was a blind man, a little blind fellow with a bearded, Jewish face, who, rowing away in the space about him with a stick, and towed by a large dog, droned through his nose with a Hungarian accent: "~Facitote caritatem~!" 
 But the blind man began to increase his stride at the same time; and, behold! the cripple and the legless man, in his bowl, came up on their side in great haste, and with great clamor of bowl and crutches, upon the pavement. 
 Shrill laughter was to be heard, the wailing of children, the voices of women. 
 At times, upon the ground, where trembled the light of the fires, mingled with large, indefinite shadows, one could behold a dog passing, which resembled a man, a man who resembled a dog. 
 On the other hand, there was a wretched fellow, preparing with celandine and beef's blood, his "leg of God," for the next day. 
 Beside him, a man with the dropsy was getting rid of his swelling, and making four or five female thieves, who were disputing at the same table, over a child who had been stolen that evening, hold their noses. 
 The three who had Gringoire in their clutches led him in front of this hogshead, and the entire bacchanal rout fell silent for a moment, with the exception of the cauldron inhabited by the child. 
 On his head he wore a sort of headgear, bound round and closed at the top. But it was difficult to make out whether it was a child's cap or a king's crown, the two things bore so strong a resemblance to each other. 
 Youmust be punished unless you are a ~capon~, a ~franc−mitou~ or a ~rifodé~; that is to say, in the slang of honest folks,−−a thief, a beggar, or a vagabond. 
 'Tis a very simple matter, gentlemen and honest bourgeois! as you treat our people in your abode, so we treat you in ours! 
 "Pardon me, monseigneur, the King of Thunes," replied Gringoire, disputing the ground foot by foot. "It is worth trouble−−One moment!−−Listen to me−−You are not going to condemn me without having heard me"−− 
 The reader can judge of the effect which this proposition produced upon Gringoire, who beheld life slipping away from him, and who was beginning to lose his hold upon it. 
 I am a vagabond, a thief, a sharper, a man of the knife, anything you please; and I am all that already, monsieur, King of Thunes, for I am a philosopher; ~et omnia in philosophia, omnes in philosopho continentur~,−−all things are contained in philosophy, all men in the philosopher, as you know." 
 These thousand tiny bellsquivered for some time with the vibration of the rope, then gradually died away, and finally became silent when the manikin had been brought into a state of immobility by that law of the pendulum which has dethroned the water clock and the hour−glass. 
 These myriad bells, with their little copper tongues, seemed to him like the mouths of so many asps, open and ready to sting and to hiss. 
 "Oh!" he said, in a very low voice, "is it possible that my life depends on the slightest vibration of the least of these bells? Oh!" he added, with clasped hands, "bells, do not ring, hand−bells do not clang, mule−bells do not quiver!" 
 Meanwhile, he heard the dreadful peal above his head, the diabolical laughter of the vagabonds, and the voice of Trouillefou saying,−− 
 "Pick me up that knave, and hang him without ceremony." 
 A moment of horrible suspense ensued for the poor victim, during which Clopin tranquilly thrust into the fire with the tip of his foot, some bits of vine shoots which the flame had not caught. 
 The unhappy wretch heard them answer: "No! no! hang him; there'll be the more fun for us all!" 
 You recollect with what amorous curiosity your thought and your gaze were riveted upon this little whirlwind, hissing and humming with wings of purple and azure, in the midst of which floated an imperceptible body, veiled by the very rapidity of its movement. 
 The aerial being which was dimly outlined amid this quivering of wings, appeared to you chimerical, imaginary, impossible to touch, impossible to see. 
 Sinking deeper and deeper into his revery: "So this," he said to himself, following her vaguely with his eyes, "is la Esmeralda! a celestial creature! a street dancer! so much, and so little! 
 'Twas she who dealt the death−blow to my mystery this morning, 'tis she who saves my life this evening! 
 By the way," said he, rising suddenly, with that sentiment of the true which formed the foundation of his character and his philosophy, "I don't know very well how it happens, but I am her husband!" 
 With this idea in his head and in his eyes, he stepped up to the young girl in a manner so military and so gallant that she drew back. 
 At the same time, the white goat placed itself in front of her, and presented to Gringoire a hostile front, bristling with two pretty horns, gilded and very sharp. 
 In the matter of love, as in all other affairs, he willingly assented to temporizing and adjusting terms; and a good supper, and an amiable tête−a−tête appeared to him, especially when he was hungry, an excellent interlude between the prologue and the catastrophe of a love adventure. 
 A moment later, there stood upon the table a loaf of rye bread, a slice of bacon, some wrinkled apples and a jug of beer. 
 "What the deuce is she thinking of?" thought Gringoire, staring at what she was gazing at; "'tis impossible that it can be that stone dwarf carved in the keystone of that arch, which thus absorbs her attention. 
 Trouble wasted. 
 She began to pull her mistress gently by the sleeve. "What dost thou want, Djali?" said the gypsy, hastily, as though suddenly awakened. 
 "Yes." She remained thoughtful for a moment, then said with a peculiar expression: "That I shall know soon." 
 "Why not this evening?" resumed the poet tenderly. "Why not me?" 
 Gringoire colored, and took the hint. It was evident that the young girl was alluding to the slight assistance which he had rendered her in the critical situation in which she had found herself two hours previously. 
 This bag exhaled a strong odor of camphor. It was covered with green silk, and bore in its centre a large piece of green glass, in imitation of an emerald. 
 Gringoire was on the point of taking the bag in his hand. She drew back. 
 "I don't know," said she. "To what language do they belong?" 
 She began to sing, to an ancient air,−− My father is a bird, my mother is a bird. I cross the water without a barque, I cross the water without a boat. 
 At the moment when we were entering the papal gate I saw a reed warbler flit through the air, that was at the end of August; I said, it will be a hard winter." 
 You must know, then, that my name is Pierre Gringoire, and that I am a son of the farmer of the notary's office of Gonesse. 
 In the winter I warmed myself in the sun, under the porch of the Hôtel de Sens, and I thought it very ridiculous that the fire on Saint John's Day was reserved for the dog days. 
 I know a great many sorts of very engaging tricks, which I will teach your goat; for example, to mimic the Bishop of Paris, that cursed Pharisee whose mill wheels splash passers−by the whole length of the Pont aux Meuniers. 
 And then my mystery will bring me in a great deal of coined money, if they will only pay me. 
 And those myriads of statues, which peopled all the spaces between the columns of the nave and the choir, kneeling, standing, equestrian, men, women, children, kings, bishops, gendarmes, in stone, in marble, in gold, in silver, in copper, in wax even,−−who has brutally swept them away? 
 And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows," high in color, "which caused the astonished eyes of our fathers to hesitate between the rose of the grand portal and the arches of the apse? 
 'Tis thus that the marvellous art of the Middle Ages has been treated in nearly every country, especially in France. 
 The Saxon architect completed the erection of the first pillars of the nave, when the pointed arch, which dates from the Crusade, arrived and placed itself as a conqueror upon the large Romanesque capitals which should support only round arches. 
 Each face, each stone of the venerable monument, is a page not only of the history of the country, but of the history of science and art as well. 
 Thus, in order to indicate here only the principal details, while the little Red Door almost attains to thelimits of the Gothic delicacy of the fifteenth century, the pillars of the nave, by their size and weight, go back to the Carlovingian Abbey of Saint−Germain des Prés. 
 There is no one, not even the hermetics, who does not find in the symbols of the grand portal a satisfactory compendium of their science, of which the Church of Saint−Jacques de la Boucherie was so complete a hieroglyph. 
 It is a graft which shoots up, a sap which circulates, a vegetation which starts forth anew. 
 There are, invariably, two naves, which intersect in a cross, and whose upper portion, rounded into an apse, forms the choir; there are always the side aisles, for interior processions, for chapels,−−a sort of lateral walks or promenades where the principal nave discharges itself through the spaces between the pillars. 
 Paris remained for many centuries in its island state, with two bridges, one on the north, the other on the south; and two bridge heads, which were at the same time its gates and its fortresses,−−the Grand−Châtelet on the right bank, the Petit−Châtelet on the left. 
 They begin to deepen; they pile story upon story; they mount upon each other; they gush forth at the top, like all laterally compressed growth, and there is a rivalry as to which shall thrust its head above its neighbors, for the sake of getting a little air. 
 Thus, beginning with the fifteenth century, where our story finds us, Paris had already outgrown the three concentric circles of walls which, from the time of Julian the Apostate, existed, so to speak, in germ in the Grand−Châtelet and the Petit−Châtelet. 
 Under Louis XI., this sea of houses was seen to be pierced at intervals by several groups of ruined towers, from the ancient wall, like the summits of hills in an inundation,−−like archipelagos of the old Paris submerged beneath the new. 
 In the fifteenth century, Paris was still divided into three wholly distinct and separate towns, each having its own physiognomy, its own specialty, its manners, customs, privileges, and history: the City, the University, the Town. 
 The culminating point of this sweep of walls was the Papal gate, that is to say, near the present site of the Pantheon. 
 Hence three entirely distinct aspects: churches abounded in the City; palaces, in the Town; and colleges, in the University. 
 The University had six gates, built by Philip Augustus; there were, beginning with la Tournelle, the Porte Saint− Victor, the Porte Bordelle, the Porte Papale, the Porte Saint− Jacques, the Porte Saint−Michel, the Porte Saint−Germain. 
 The first of these streets ran from the Porte Saint−Martin: it was called the Rue Saint−Jacques in the University, Rue de la Juiverie in the City, Rue Saint−Martin in the Town; it crossed the water twice, under the name of the Petit Pont and the Pont Notre− Dame. 
 All the other veins of the triple city either derived their supply from them or emptied into them. 
 But these are the principal masses which were then to be distinguished when the eye began to accustom itself to this tumult of edifices. 
 This form of a ship had also struck the heraldic scribes; for it is from that, and not from the siege by the Normans, that the ship which blazons the old shield of Paris, comes, according to Favyn and Pasquier. 
 Only here, this tower was the most audacious, the most open, the most ornamented spire of cabinet−maker's work that ever let the sky peep through its cone of lace. 
 This side of the Seine was, however, the least mercantile of the two. Students furnished more of a crowd and more noise there than artisans, and there was not, properly speaking, any quay, except from the Pont Saint−Michel to the Tour de Nesle. 
 The rest of the bank of the Seine was now a naked strand, the same as beyond the Bernardins; again, a throng of houses, standing with their feet in the water, as between the two bridges. 
 There was a great uproar of laundresses; they screamed, and talked, and sang from morning till night along the beach, and beat a great deal of linen there, just as in our day. 
 A continual flux of a thousand black points which passed each other on the pavements made everything move before the eyes; it was the populace seen thus from aloft and afar. 
 First the streets, crossed and entangled, forming a hundred amusing figures in the block; around the market−place, it was like a star with a thousand rays. 
 Between the Rue Neuve−du− Temple and the Rue Saint−Martin, there was the Abbey of Saint−Martin, in the midst of its gardens, a superb fortified church, whose girdle of towers, whose diadem of bell towers, yielded in force and splendor only to Saint−Germain des Prés. Between the Rue Saint−Martin and the Rue Saint− Denis, spread the enclosure of the Trinité. 
 Lastly, between the Rue Saint−Denis, and the Rue Montorgueil, stood the Filles−Dieu. 
 Finally, the fourth compartment, which stretched itself out in the agglomeration of the roofs on the right bank, and which occupied the western angle of the enclosure, and the banks of the river down stream, was a fresh cluster of palaces and Hôtels pressed close about the base of the Louvre. 
 In the centre, the island of the City, resembling as to form an enormous tortoise, and throwing out its bridges with tiles for scales; like legs from beneath its gray shell of roofs. 
 Across all, the Seine, "foster−mother Seine," as says Father Du Breul, blocked with islands, bridges, and boats. 
 It has a roof almost as flat as roofs in the East, which involves sweeping the roof in winter, when it snows; and of course roofs are made to be swept. 
 Nevertheless, this sea of harmony is not a chaos; great and profound as it is, it has not lost its transparency; you behold the windings of each group of notes which escapes from the belfries. 
 They wereAgnes la Herme, Jehanne de la Tarme, Henriette la Gaultière, Gauchère la Violette, all four widows, all four dames of the Chapel Etienne Haudry, who had quitted their house with the permission of their mistress, and in conformity with the statutes of Pierre d'Ailly, in order to come and hear the sermon. 
 "What is this, sister?" said Agnes to Gauchère, gazing at the little creature exposed, which was screaming and writhing on the wooden bed, terrified by so many glances. 
 "To think that Monsieur of Reims sent this enormity to Monsieur of Paris," added la Gaultière, clasping her hands. 
 "Ah! good heavens!" said an old woman among the spectators, "and that besides our having had a considerable pestilence last year, and that they say that the English are going to disembark in a company at Harfleur." 
 He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low. 
 Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne. 
 Theology conquered, he had plunged into decretals. 
 He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented. 
 There was a miller's wife there who was nursing a fine child; it was not far from the university, and Claude carried the little Jehan to her in his own arms. 
 Later on, the first time that he caught hold, mechanically, of the ropes to the towers, and hung suspended from them, and set the bell to clanging, it produced upon his adopted father, Claude, the effect of a child whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak. 
 He often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven points of the carving. 
 In closing, it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo. 
 From the chime in the spire, over the intersection of the aisles and nave, to the great bell of the front, he cherished a tenderness for them all. 
 All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main. 
 It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes, but no longer sight. 
 A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre− Dame. 
 Little Jehan Frollo, surnamed (~du Moulin~) "of the Mill" because of the place where he had been reared, had not grown up in the direction which Claude would have liked to impose upon him. 
 Now it was a ~bejaune~ or yellow beak (as they called the new arrivals at the university), whom he had been mauling by way of welcome; a precious tradition which has been carefully preserved to our own day. 
 Hence, he became more and more learned, and, at the same time, as a natural consequence, more and more rigid as a priest, more andmore sad as a man. 
 In the darkness, at that height, it produced a singular effect; and the goodwives said: "There's the archdeacon blowing! hell is sparkling up yonder!" 
 It was evident that the bellringer was to serve the archdeacon for a given time, at the end of which he would carry away the latter's soul, by way of payment. 
 Thus the archdeacon, in spite of the excessive austerity of his life, was in bad odor among all pious souls; and there was no devout nose so inexperienced that it could not smell him out to be a magician. 
 Sometimes a group of squalid old crones, squatting in a file under the shadow of the steps to a porch, scolded noisily as the archdeacon and the bellringer passed, and tossed them this encouraging welcome, with a curse: "Hum! there's a fellow whose soul is made like the other one's body!" Or a band of schoolboys and street urchins, playing hop−scotch, rose in a body and saluted him classically, with some cry in Latin: "~Eia! eia! 
 Both wore long slate−colored robes, furred with minever, girded and closed, with caps of the same stuff and hue. 
 "Do you know that you made a great figure on Christmas Day at the bead of your company of the chamber of accounts, Monsieur President?" 
 He was, so far as the feeble light of the lamp permitted one to judge, an old man about sixty years of age and of medium stature, who appeared somewhat sickly and broken in health. 
 Gossip Tourangeau obeyed, and read this inscription engraved above his head: "Medicine is the daughter of dreams.−−JAMBLIQUE." 
 "I deny," said Dom Claude coldly, "neither pharmacy nor the invalid. I reject the physician." 
 Coictier calmed down, muttering in a low tone,−−"After all, he's mad." 
 "Alchemy." Coictier exclaimed, "Pardieu, Dom Claude, alchemy has its use, no doubt, but why blaspheme medicine and astrology?" 
 "Whose archdeacon I am?" Dom Claude contented himself with replying, with tranquil hauteur. 
 Here Jacques Coictier, who had been unhorsed by the archdeacon's impetuous replies, regained his saddle, and interrupted him with the triumphant tone of one learned man correcting another,−−"~Erras amice Claudi~. 
 Then he added these mysterious words: "Alas! alas! small things come at the end of great things; a tooth triumphs over a mass. 
 Our lady readers will pardon us if we pause for a moment to seek what could have been the thought concealed beneath those enigmatic words of the archdeacon: "This will kill that. The book will kill the edifice." 
 It was the affright of the priest in the presence of a new agent, the printing press. 
 It was the terror and dazzled amazement of the men of the sanctuary, in the presence of the luminous press of Gutenberg. 
 It was the pulpit and the manuscript taking the alarm at the printed word: something similar to the stupor of a sparrow which should behold the angel Legion unfold his six million wings. 
 It was the cry of the prophet who already hears emancipated humanity roaring and swarming; who beholds in the future, intelligence sapping faith, opinion dethroning belief, the world shaking off Rome. It was the prognostication of the philosopher who sees human thought, volatilized by the press, evaporating from the theocratic recipient. 
 It was the terror of the soldier who examines the brazen battering ram, and says:−−"The tower will crumble." It signified that one power was about to succeed another power. 
 In this connection the archdeacon's vague formula had a second sense. It meant, "Printing will kill architecture." 
 And not only the form of edifices, but the sites selected for them, revealed the thought which they represented, according as the symbol to be expressed was graceful or grave. 
 Greece crowned her mountains with a temple harmonious to the eye; India disembowelled hers, to chisel therein those monstrous subterranean pagodas, borne up by gigantic rows of granite elephants. 
 One feels everywhere in it authority, unity, the impenetrable, the absolute, Gregory VII.; always the priest, never the man; everywhere caste, never the people. 
 Farewell to mystery, myth, law. Fancy and caprice, welcome. 
 Hence the rapid and innumerable transformations of that architecture which owns but three centuries, so striking after the stagnant immobility of the Romanesque architecture, which owns six or seven. 
 Hence the immense quantity of cathedrals which have covered Europe−−a number so prodigious that one can hardly believe it even after having verified it. 
 Moreover, this phenomenon of an architecture of the people following an architecture of caste, which we have just been observing in the Middle Ages, is reproduced with every analogous movement in the human intelligence at the other great epochs of history. 
 Hence, edifices comprehensible to every soul, to every intelligence, to every imagination, symbolical still, but as easy to understand as nature. 
 In proportion as architecture ebbs, printing swells and grows. 
 Some compiler of statistics has calculated, that if all the volumes which have issued from the press since Gutenberg's day were to be piled one upon another, they would fill the space between the earth and the moon; but it is not that sort of grandeur of which we wished to speak. 
 To the left of the entrance has been fixed the ancient bas−relief, in white marble, of Homer; to the right, the polyglot Bible rears its seven heads. 
 More than this; the brave chevalier had obtained the reversion of the office for his son, and for two years already, the name of the noble man Jacques d'Estouteville, equerry, had figured beside his at the head of the register of the salary list of the provostship of Paris. 
 Nevertheless, with so many reasons for taking life patiently and joyously, Messire Robert d'Estouteville woke up on the morning of the seventh of January, 1482, in a very surly and peevish mood. 
 Below sat the clerk of the court, scribbling; opposite was the populace; and in front of the door, and in front of the table were many sergeants of the provostship in sleeveless jackets of violet camlet, with white crosses. 
 For having been passed and received master of the said trade! That's his entrance money. 
 Aiglet de Soins, Hutin de Mailly Two equerries, ~Corpus Christi~! 
 Good! Another amorous woman! 
 Thibaud−la−Thibaude, neither more nor less! For having come from the Rue Glatigny! 
 If his deafness did happen to betray him here and there, by some incoherent apostrophe or some unintelligible question, it passed for profundity with some, and for imbecility with others. 
 The judge, being deaf, and being in no way warned of the deafness of the accused, thought that the latter had answered, as all accused do in general, and therefore he pursued, with his mechanical and stupid self−possession,−− 
 Messire Robert d'Estouteville frowned and made a gesture so imperious and significant to Quasimodo, that the deaf man in some measure understood it. 
 "~Ventre Dieu~! 'tis well adjudged!" cried the little scholar, Jehan Frollo du Moulin, from his corner. 
 The provost turned and fixed his flashing eyes once more on Quasimodo. 
 One went straight to the point then, and at the end of every path there was immediately visible, without thickets and without turnings; the wheel, the gibbet, or the pillory. 
 The clerk presented the sentence to the provost, who affixed his seal to it, and departed to pursue his round of the audience hall, in a frame of mind which seemed destined to fill all the jails in Paris that day. 
 The festival, the ambassadors, Coppenole, the Pope of the Fools, are in all mouths; they vie with each other, each trying to criticise it best and laugh the most. 
 It took the thing in the block, honored, venerated, hallowed the sacrifice at need, but did not analyze the sufferings, and felt but moderate pity for them. 
 "It was at the Hôtel−de−Ville," retorted Oudarde sharply, "and Dr. Scourable addressed them a harangue in Latin, which pleased them greatly. 
 "The gypsy!" said Mahiette, suddenly retracing her steps, and clasping her son's arm forcibly. "God preserve me from it! 
 "Oh! you must tell us that story, my good Mahiette," said Gervaise, taking her arm. 
 At fourteen years of age! do you see? 
 "Patience!" resumed Mahiette, "you will see one child.−−In '66, 'twill be sixteen years ago this month, at Sainte− Paule's day, Paquette was brought to bed of a little girl. 
 She had recognized this fact after having tried to love a thief, the only man who wanted her; but after a short time, she perceived that the thief despised her. 
 They certainly were the two prettiest little pink shoes that could be seen. 
 They were no longer than my thumb, and one had to see the child's little feet come out of them, in order to believe that they had been able to get into them. 
 Her pretty, little rosy feet above all were an endless source of wonderment, they were a delirium of joy! 
 It appears that they had formerly been Saracens, which was why they believed in Jupiter, and claimed ten livres of Tournay from all archbishops, bishops, and mitred abbots with croziers. 
 Nothing remained of the child, but one of her pretty little shoes. 
 She was breathless, dishevelled, frightful to see, and there was a fire in her eyes which dried her tears. She stopped the passers−by and cried: 'My daughter! my daughter! my pretty little daughter! 
 If any one will give me back my daughter, I will he his servant, the servant of his dog, and he shall eat my heart if he will.' 
 During her absence, a neighbor had seen two gypsies ascend up to it with a bundle in their arms, then descend again, after closing the door. 
 Instead of her pretty little Agnes, so rosy and so fresh, who was a gift of the good God, a sort of hideous little monster, lame, one−eyed, deformed, was crawling and squalling over the floor. She hid her eyes in horror. 
 Our children are the marrow of our bones, you see.−−−My poor Eustache! thou art so fair!−−If you only knew how nice he is! yesterday he said to me: 'I want to be a gendarme, that I do.' 
 Oh! my Eustache! if I were to lose thee!−−All at once la Chantefleurie rose, and set out to run through Reims, screaming: 'To the gypsies' camp! to the gypsies' camp! 
 The gypsies were gone. 
 On the morrow, two leagues from Reims, on a heath between Gueux and Tilloy, the remains of a large fire were found, some ribbons which had belonged to Paquette's child, drops of blood, and the dung of a ram. 
 "And you did all the better," resumed Oudarde, "to flee with your Eustache just now, since these also are gypsies from Poland." 
 "Pologne, Catalogue, Valogne, I always confound those three provinces, One thing is certain, that they are gypsies." 
 "Who certainly," added Gervaise, "have teeth long enough to eat little children. 
 Nevertheless, there were people of the Cabaret les Vantes, who said that they had seen her pass along the road to Paris, walking on the pebbles with her bare feet. 
 "Stop! my cake!" said he, rubbing both ears alternatively with his shoulders, which, in such cases, is the supreme sign of discontent. 
 The cell was small, broader than it was long, with an arched ceiling, and viewed from within, it bore a considerable resemblance to the interior of a huge bishop's mitre. 
 It was with difficulty that one distinguished, beneath her hair which spread to the ground, a gaunt and severe profile; her dress barely allowed the extremity of a bare foot to escape, which contracted on the hard, cold pavement. 
 The little of human form of which one caught a sight beneath this envelope of mourning, caused a shudder. 
 At length Gervaise, the most curious of the three, and consequently the least sensitive, tried to make the recluse speak: "Sister! Sister Gudule!" 
 She repeated this call three times, raising her voice each time. The recluse did not move; not a word, not a glance, not a sigh, not a sign of life. 
 At the sound of this clear, fresh, ringing child's voice, the recluse trembled; she turned her head with the sharp, abrupt movement of a steel spring, her long, fleshless hands cast aside the hair from her brow, and she fixed upon the child, bitter, astonished, desperate eyes. 
 A moment later, however, she moved, and they beheld her drag herself, on her knees and elbows, to the corner where the little shoe was. 
 "Wait," said she. Then bending towards the window, "Paquette!" she said, "Paquette le Chantefleurie!" 
 A wooden shaft, which set in motion a capstan concealed in the interior of the little edifice, imparted a rotatory motion to the wheel, which always maintained its horizontal position, and in this manner presented the face of the condemned man to all quarters of the square in succession. 
 They were forced to content themselves with those four stretches of rubble work, backed with sandstone, and a wretched stone gibbet, meagre and bare, on one side. 
 He closed his single eye, allowed his head to droop upon his breast, and feigned death. 
 Nothing could force a movement from him. Neither his blood, which did not cease to flow, nor the blows which redoubled in fury, nor the wrath of the torturer, who grew excited himself and intoxicated with the execution, nor the sound of the horrible thongs, more sharp andwhistling than the claws of scorpions. 
 At length a bailiff from the Châtelet clad in black, mounted on a black horse, who had been stationed beside the ladder since the beginning of the execution, extended his ebony wand towards the hour−glass. 
 He had still to undergo that hour of pillory which Master Florian Barbedienne had so judiciously added to the sentence of Messire Robert d'Estouteville; all to the greater glory of the old physiological and psychological play upon words of Jean de Cumène, ~Surdus absurdus~: a deaf man is absurd. 
 As long as it remains in its state of primitive ignorance, of moral and intellectual minority, it can be said of it as of the child,−−'Tis the pitiless age. 
 Then the wretched man, unable to break his collar, like that of a chained wild beast, became tranquil once more; only at intervals a sigh of rage heaved the hollows of his chest. 
 "He, good, my son!" howled a cripple, making an effort to reach him with his crutch, "will you cast any more spells on us from the top of the towers of Notre−Dame?" 
 "Here's a drinking cup!" chimed in a man, flinging a broken jug at his breast. "'Twas you that made my wife, simply because she passed near you, give birth to a child with two heads!" 
 Then, from that eye which had been, up to that moment, so dry and burning, a big tear was seen to fall, and roll slowly down that deformed visage so long contracted with despair. 
 "'Tis a terrible child!" said the mother, smiling and scolding at one and the same time. "Do you see, Oudarde? 
 So his grandfather says that be will be a captain. Just let me catch you at it again, Master Eustache. 
 It was one of those spring days which possesses so much sweetness and beauty, that all Paris turns out into the squares and promenades and celebrates them as though they were Sundays. 
 Opposite the lofty cathedral, reddened by the setting sun, on the stone balcony built above the porch of a rich Gothic house, which formed the angle of the square and the Rue du Parvis, several young girls were laughing and chatting with every sort of grace and mirth. 
 At the end of the room, by the side of a lofty chimney blazoned with arms from top to bottom, in a rich red velvet arm−chair, sat Dame de Gondelaurier, whose five and fifty years were written upon her garments no less distinctly than upon her face. 
 Can one be more white and blonde? are not her hands perfect? and that neck−−does it not assume all the curves of the swan in ravishing fashion? 
 "But do say something," said Madame Aloise, suddenly giving his shoulder a push; "you have grown very timid." 
 "Fair cousin," he said, approaching Fleur−de−Lys, "what is the subject of this tapestry work which you are fashioning?' "Fair cousin," responded Fleur−de−Lys, in an offended tone, "I have already told you three times. 
 "Who, my fair cousin, is this big gendarme, who is puffing out his cheeks to their full extent and blowing a trumpet?" 
 At that moment Bérangère de Champchevrier, a slender little maid of seven years, who was peering into the square through the trefoils of the balcony, exclaimed, "Oh! look, fair Godmother Fleur−de−Lys, at that pretty dancer who is dancing on the pavement and playing the tambourine in the midst of the loutish bourgeois!" 
 Nevertheless, the fair Fleur−de−Lys's was a charming and noble service, and such it had formerly appeared to him; but the captain had gradually become blase'; the prospect of a speedy marriage cooled him more every day. 
 He had, nevertheless, received from his family some education and some politeness of manner; but he had been thrown on the world too young, he had been in garrison at too early an age, and every day the polish of a gentleman became more and more effaced by the rough friction of his gendarme's cross−belt. 
 "Fair cousin, did you not speak to us of a little Bohemian whom you saved a couple of months ago, while making the patrol with the watch at night, from the hands of a dozen robbers?" 
 She turned her head towards the point whence this call proceeded, her brilliant eyes rested on Phoebus, and she stopped short. 
 This remark, which a more delicate admirer would have uttered in a lower tone, at least was not of a nature to dissipate the feminine jealousies which were on the alert before the gypsy. 
 The name of some festival when the bells are pealed! So he took the liberty of carrying you off, as though you were made for beadles! 
 A bellringer carrying off a wench, like a vicomte! a lout poaching on the game of gentlemen! that is a rare piece of assurance. 
 Not being able to impugn her beauty, they attacked her costume. 
 "That is true," said la Montmichel; "what makes you run about the streets thus, without guimpe or ruff?" 
 One would have thought they were young Roman dames thrusting golden pins into the breast of a beautiful slave. 
 Hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting, when the child, with surprise, beheld the goat (one of whose "miracles" this was no doubt), draw out certain letters with its golden hoof, and arrange them, with gentle pushes, in a certain order. 
 He was engaged in so profound a contemplation, that he did not notice the passage of his adopted father. His savage eye had a singular expression; it was a charmed, tender look. 
 "This is strange!" murmured Claude. "Is it the gypsy at whom he is thus gazing?" 
 He continued his descent. At the end of a few minutes, the anxious archdeacon entered upon the Place from the door at the base of the tower. 
 The harsh voice of the archdeacon threw the poor fellow into such a commotion that he lost his equilibrium, together with his whole edifice, and the chair and the cat tumbled pell−mell upon the heads of the spectators, in the midst of inextinguishable hootings. 
 Only the great rose window of the façade, whose thousand colors were steeped in a ray of horizontal sunlight, glittered in the gloom like a mass of diamonds, and threw its dazzling reflection to the other end of the nave. 
 The gaze was not the one which Gringoire feared, ashamed as he was of having been caught by a grave and learned person in the costume of a buffoon. 
 "Messire," said Gringoire, piteously, "it is, in fact, an amazing accoutrement. You see me no more comfortable in it than a cat coiffed with a calabash. 
 Happily, I found that I was rather strong in the jaw; so I said to this jaw,−−perform some feats of strength and of equilibrium: nourish thyself. ~Ale te ipsam~. 
 One thing is certain, that la Esmeralda had come to France while still very young, by way of Hungary. 
 In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the tambourine to the goat in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from him the trick desired. 
 Of the double noise which constitutes a church, the organ within, the bell without, the organ alone remained. 
 Meanwhile, the forgotten bells died away abruptly and all together, to the great disappointment of the lovers of bell ringing, who were listening in good faith to the peal from above the Pont du Change, and who went away dumbfounded, like a dog who has been offered a bone and given a stone. 
 Then he hastily donned his long jacket with furred half− sleeves, picked up his cap, and went out like a man driven to desperation. 
 "By the ravens of the Holy Virgin! it must needs be a curious thing, that cell which my reverend brother hides so secretly! 
 'Tis said that he lights up the kitchens of hell there, and that he cooks the philosopher's stone there over a hot fire. ~Bédieu~! I care no more for the philosopher's stone than for a pebble, and I would rather find over his furnace an omelette of Easter eggs and bacon, than the biggest philosopher's stone in the world."' 
 Persons desirous of visiting this door at the present day will recognize it by this inscription engraved in white letters on the black wall: "J'ADORE CORALIE, 1823. 
 The inquisitive scholar took advantage of this circumstance to examine the cell for a few moments at his leisure. 
 The ray of light which penetrated through this aperture made its way through a spider's circular web, which tastefully inscribed its delicate rose in the arch of the window, and in the centre of which the insect architect hung motionless, like the hub of this wheel of lace. 
 It was, in fact, a strangely confused mingling of all human philosophies, all reveries, all human wisdom. Here and there one shone out from among the rest like a banner among lance heads. 
 Generally, it was a brief Greek or Roman device, such as the Middle Ages knew so well how to formulate.−−~Unde? Inde?−−Homo homini monstrurn−Ast'ra, castra, nomen, numen.−− Mέγα βιβλίον, μέγα κακόν .−−Sapere aude. 
 But 'tis exceeding hard to obtain this ray pure, because of the simultaneous presence of other stars whose rays mingle with it. Flamel esteemed it more simple to operate upon terrestrial fire. 
 The diamond is contained in the carbon, gold is in the fire. 
 Yes, the sage is right; in truth, Maria, Sophia, la Esmeral−−Damnation! always that thought!" 
 Suddenly, Dom Claude sprang up, seized a compass and engraved in silence upon the wall in capital letters, this Greek word 
 I left the door unlocked expressly; enter Master Jacques!" The scholar entered boldly. 
 "A little lecture on morality, of which I stand greatly in need," Jehan did not dare to add aloud,−−"and a little money of which I am in still greater need." This last member of his phrase remained unuttered. 
 A slight flush spread over the cheeks of the priest with their high bones, like the puff of smoke which announces on the outside the secret commotions of a volcano. 
 Master Jehan, who possessed all the artful ways of a spoiled child, judged that the moment was a favorable one in which to risk his request. 
 "And what are you going to do with it?" This question caused a flash of hope to gleam before Jehan's eyes. 
 "Hum," said the archdeacon; "those are names as fit for a good work as a catapult for the chief altar." It is certain that Jehan had made a very bad choice of names for his two friends. 
 "And then," pursued the sagacious Claude, "what sort of an infant's outfit is it that is to cost three forms, and that for the child of a Haudriette? Since when have the Haudriette widows taken to having babes in swaddling−clothes?" 
 I need money in order to go and see Isabeau la Thierrye to−night; in the Val−d' Amour!" "Impure wretch!" exclaimed the priest. 
 He bit his lips and his wrath was drowned in a crimson flush. 
 "Oh! good Brother Claude," resumed Jehan, emboldened by this smile, "look at my worn out boots. Is there a cothurnus in the world more tragic than these boots, whose soles are hanging out their tongues?" 
 The archdeacon promptly returned to his original severity. "I will send you some new boots, but no money." 
 "Only a poor little parisis, brother," continued the suppliant Jehan. "I will learn Gratian by heart, I will believe firmly in God, I will be a regular Pythagoras of science and virtue. 
 Dom Claude shook his wrinkled head: "~Qui non laborat~−−" Jehan did not allow him to finish. 
 He had made the latter a sign to seat himself on a stool near the door, and, after several moments of a silence which appeared to be a continuation of a preceding meditation, he said to him in a rather patronizing way, "Good day, Master Jacques." 
 "Give it here," said the archdeacon. And casting his eyes upon this writing: "Pure magic, Master Jacques!" he exclaimed. 
 Poor man! he will have suffered like Mummol. 
 What an idea to go to the witches' sabbath! a butler of the Court of Accounts, who ought to know Charlemagne's text; ~Stryga vel masea~!−−In the matter of the little girl,−−Smelarda, as they call her,−−I will await your orders. 
 Ah! as we pass through the portal, you will explain to me also the meaning of the gardener painted in relief, which one sees as one enters the church. 
 The archdeacon shook his head, with a bitter smile. "Master Jacques read Michel Psellus' '~Dialogus de Energia et Operatione Daemonum~.' 
 I have my suspicions of it," said Jacques Charmolue. "But one must practise a bit of hermetic science when one is only procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, at thirty crowns tournois a year. 
 It was the scholar, who, ill at ease, and greatly bored in his hiding−place, had succeeded in discovering there a stale crust and a triangle of mouldy cheese, and had set to devouring the whole without ceremony, by way of consolation and breakfast. 
 You know what Servius saith: '~Nullus enim locus sine genio est~,−−for there is no place that hath not its spirit.'" 
 He approached them on tiptoe, and heard the archdeacon say in a low tone to Charmolue: "'Twas Guillaume de Paris who caused a Job to be carved upon this stone of the hue of lapis−lazuli, gilded on the edges. 
 "Fye, Captain Phoebus de Châteaupers!" Phoebus counted the coins, and turning towards Jehan with solemnity, "Do you know, Jehan, that there are three and twenty sous parisis! whom have you plundered to−night, in the Street Cut−Weazand?" 
 Jehan flung back his blonde and curly head, and said, half− closing his eyes disdainfully,−− "We have a brother who is an archdeacon and a fool." 
 He did not know it, but it was at least a Phoebus, and that magic name sufficed to make the archdeacon follow the two heedless comrades with the stealthy tread of a wolf, listening to their words and observing their slightest gestures with anxious attention. 
 Moreover, nothing was easier than to hear everything they said, as they talked loudly, not in the least concerned that the passers−by were taken into their confidence. 
 He heard them singing at the top of their lungs the ancient refrain,−− The children of the Petits Carreaux let themselves be hung like calves. 
 Through the mist which the warmth of the room spread over the window in front, a hundred confused figures could be seen swarming, and from time to time a burst of noisy laughter broke forth from it. 
 You know that I made an appointment with that little girl at the end of the Pont Saint− Michel, and I can only take her to the Falourdel's, the old crone of the bridge, and that I must pay for a chamber. 
 There were then in circulation, strange stories of a surly monk, a nocturnal prowler about the streets of Paris, and they recurred confusedly to his memory. 
 The hand of the shadow emerged from beneath its mantle and descended upon the arm of Phoebus with the grip of an eagle's talon; at the same time the shadow spoke,−− 
 So I will betake myself to my rendezvous; it is for seven o'clock, as you know." Here Phoebus scratched his ear. 
 "I will first show you the way," said Phoebus to his companion, "I will then go in search of the fair one who is awaiting me near the Petit−Châtelet." 
 Tête−Dieu! Ventre−Dieu~!" replied the captain. 
 On entering this lair, Phoebus's mysterious companion raised his mantle to his very eyes. 
 What was taking place at that moment in the gloomy soul of the archdeacon? God and himself could alone know. 
 The cat−faced old crone was the first to emerge from the trap−door, lamp in hand; then Phoebus, twirling his moustache, then a third person, that beautiful and graceful figure, la Esmeralda. 
 The gypsy looked at the hilt, the blade; examined the cipher on the guard with adorable curiosity, and kissed the sword, saying,−− 
 "Do I love thee, angel of my life!" exclaimed the captain, half kneeling. "My body, my blood, my soul, all are thine; all are for thee. 
 "Die!" exclaimed the amorous captain, "What are you saying, my lovely angel? 
 Eighty thousand armed men, thirty thousand white harnesses, short coats or coats of mail; the sixty−seven banners of the trades; the standards of the parliaments, of the chamber of accounts, of the treasury of the generals, of the aides of the mint; a devilish fine array, in short! 
 A great thing is marriage, truly! one is none the less loving for not having spit Latin into a priest's shop!" 
 Any one who could, at that moment, have seen the face of the unhappy man glued to the wormeaten bars, would have thought that he beheld the face of a tiger glaring from the depths of a cage at some jackal devouring a gazelle. 
 Oh, take me! take all! do what you will with me, I am thine. 
 Whatmatters to me my mother! 
 And when I grow old or ugly, Phoebus, when I am no longer good to love you, you will suffer me to serve you still. 
 So saying, she threw her arms round the officer's neck; she looked up at him, supplicatingly, with a beautiful smile, and all in tears. 
 One day, as he was passing sadly before the criminal Tournelle, he perceived a considerable crowd at one of the gates of the Palais de Justice. 
 A large figure of Christ might be vaguely descried above the judges, and everywhere there were pikes and halberds, upon whose points the reflection of the candles placed tips of fire. 
 They say to me,−−'The Sainte−Marthe chamber.'−−'Tis my upper chamber, my lords, my cleanest. 
 I show the captain and the wench to the upper chamber, and I leave them alone; that is to say, with the goat. 
 They carried off the officer, poor young man, and the wench with her bosom all bare. But wait, the worst is that on the next day, when I wanted to take the crown to buy tripe, I found a dead leaf in its place." 
 A bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile, who made a doleful shake of the head, and passed it on to the president, who gave it to the procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, and thus it made the circuit of the hail. 
 A counsellor took up the word. "Witness, two men went upstairs together in your house: the black man, whom you first saw disappear and afterwards swimming in the Seine, with his priestly garments, and the officer. 
 The goat looked at it with an intelligent eye, raised its gilded hoof, and struck seven blows. 
 It was, in fact, seven o'clock. A movement of terror ran through the crowd. 
 "Horror!" exclaimed the young girl, hiding her face in her hands. "My Phoebus! 
 "Do you persist in your denial?" demanded the president coldly. 
 The president continued squarely,−− "Then how do you explain the facts laid to your charge?" She replied in a broken voice,−− "I have already told you. 
 CHAPTER II. CONTINUATION OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF. 
 At the clanking of their frightful irons, the unhappy child quivered like a dead frog which is being galvanized. "Oh!" she murmured, so low that no one heard her; "Oh, my Phoebus!" 
 This spectacle would have rent any other heart than those of her judges. One would have pronounced her a poor sinful soul, being tortured by Satan beneath the scarlet wicket of hell. 
 And, addressing the torturers, "Release the prisoner, and take her back to the court." 
 CHAPTER III. END OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS TURNED INTO A DRY LEAF. 
 On the part of the audience there was the feeling of impatience gratified which one experiences at the theatre at the end of the last entr'acte of the comedy, when the curtain rises and the conclusion is about to begin. 
 On the part of the judges, it was the hope of getting their suppers sooner. 
 The little goat also bleated with joy. He tried to run towards his mistress, but they had tied him to the bench. 
 Opposite them, at the extremity of the long hail, they could see avaguely white point standing out against the sombre background. This was the accused. 
 Between men and himself, the condemned man felt a pile of stones and jailers weighing down upon his head; and the entire prison, the massive bastille was nothing more than an enormous, complicated lock, which barred him off from the rest of the world. 
 To tell the whole, however, she also felt, from time to time, in that cesspool of mire and darkness, something cold passing over her foot or her arm, and she shuddered. 
 At the same time, the heavy lock creaked, the trap grated on its rusty hinges, turned, and she beheld a lantern, a hand, and the lower portions of the bodies of two men, the door being too low to admit of her seeing their heads. The light pained her so acutely that she shut her eyes. 
 When she opened them again the door was closed, the lantern was deposited on one of the steps of the staircase; a man alone stood before her. 
 This apparition, always so fatal for her, and which had thus driven her on from misfortune to misfortune, even to torture, roused her from her stupor. 
 Had it not been for him, my God, how happy it should have been! 
 Priests consulted me on chastity; doctors, on doctrines. 
 A creature so beautiful that God would have preferred her to the Virgin and have chosen her for his mother and have wished to be born of her if she had been in existence when he was made man! 
 Then−−how stop myself on that slope of hell?−−then I no longer belonged to myself. 
 "One day,−−again the sun was shining brilliantly−−I behold man pass me uttering your name and laughing, who carries sensuality in his eyes. 
 "Not that name!" said the priest, grasping her arm violently. 
 "Utter not that name! 
 Yes, under one of the priests' cowls, there were the contortions of the damned. 
 When you were brought in, I was there; when you were questioned, I was there.−−Den of wolves!−−It was my crime, it was my gallows that I beheld being slowly reared over your head. 
 We would flee−−I would help you to flee,−−we would go somewhere, we would seek that spot on earth, where the sun is brightest, the sky the bluest, where the trees are most luxuriant. 
 One May morning, when the sun was rising on one of those dark blue skies against which Garofolo loves to place his Descents from the Cross, the recluse of the Tour−Roland heard a sound of wheels, of horses and irons in the Place de Grève. 
 She was somewhat aroused by it, knotted her hair upon her ears in order to deafen herself, and resumed her contemplation, on her knees, of the inanimate object which she had adored for fifteen years. 
 It seemed as though her grief were breaking forth more violently than usual; and she could be heard outside lamenting in a loud and monotonous voice which rent the heart. 
 Has the good God no mercy?−−Oh! give me only salt and black bread, only let me have my daughter to warm me like a sun! Alas! 
 Ah! fifteen years! she will be grown up now! −−Unhappy child! what! it is really true then I shall never see her more, not even in heaven, for I shall not go there myself. 
 Oh! what misery to think that here is her shoe, and that that is all!" 
 "They are going to hang a gypsy to−day." With the abrupt leap of that spider which we have seen fling itself upon a fly at the trembling of its web, she rushed to her air−hole, which opened as the reader knows, on the Place de Grève. 
 When the archdeacon had repeated to the condemned girl; "He is dead," the fact is that he knew nothing about it, but that he believed it, that he counted on it, that he did not doubt it, that he devoutly hoped it. 
 Fashionable society of that day hardly knew the name of the victim who passed by at the corner of the street, and it was the populace at the most who regaled themselves with this coarse fare. 
 Hence Phoebus's mind was soon at ease on the score of the enchantress Esmeralda, or Similar, as he called her, concerning the blow from the dagger of the Bohemian or of the surly monk (it mattered little which tohim), and as to the issue of the trial. 
 Her magnificent blond hair was plaited in a ravishing manner, she was dressed entirely in that sky blue which becomes fair people so well, a bit of coquetry which she had learned from Colombe, and her eyes were swimming in that languor of love which becomes them still better. 
 Here Phoebus, whose imagination was endowed with but mediocre power of creation, began to find himself in a quandary as to a means of extricating himself for his prowess. 
 "Oh! how do I know?−−a mere nothing, a horse, a remark! Fair cousin," he exclaimed, for the sake of changing the conversation, "what noise is this in the Cathedral Square?" 
 He approached the window. "Oh! ~Mon Dieu~, fair cousin, how many people there are on the Place!" 
 Alas! 'tis a sad thing to think that all that has existed and exists no longer!" 
 Phoebus had returned and was leaning on the back of his betrothed's chair, a charming post whence his libertine glance plunged into all the openings of Fleur−de−Lys's gorget. 
 "I swear it, fair angel!" replied Phoebus, and his passionate glances aided the sincere tone of his voice in convincing Fleur−de−Lys. 
 The little wall, breast high, which surrounded the Place, would not have sufficed to keep it free had it not been lined with a thick hedge of sergeants and hackbuteers, culverines in hand. 
 The large doors of the church were closed, and formed a contrast with the innumerable windows on the Place, which, open to their very gables, allowed a view of thousands of heads heaped up almost like the piles of bullets in a park of artillery. 
 From time to time, a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general clamor. 
 "Fool! t'is here that she is to make her apology in her shift! the good God is going to cough Latin in her face! 
 The sergeants of the watch were clearing a passage for it through the crowd, by stout blows from their clubs. 
 Beside the cart rode several officers of justice and police, recognizable by their black costume and their awkwardness in the saddle. 
 The crowd became silent, and, in the midst of this silence full of anxiety and solemnity, the two leaves of the grand door swung back, as of themselves, on their hinges, which gave a creak like the sound of a fife. 
 Then there became visible in all its length, the deep, gloomy church, hung in black, sparely lighted with a few candles gleaming afar off on the principal altar, opened in the midst of the Place which was dazzling with light, like the mouth of a cavern. 
 But a few heads of priests could be seen moving confusedly in the distant choir stalls, and, at the moment when the great door opened, there escaped from the church a loud, solemn, and monotonous chanting, which cast over the head of the condemned girl, in gusts, fragments of melancholy psalms,−− 
 For thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas, and the floods compassed me about." 
 And at the very beginning he had securely fastened to one of the small columns a large knotted rope, one end of which trailed on the flight of steps below. 
 This was done with such rapidity, that had it taken place at night, the whole of it could have been seen in the space of a single flash of lightning. 
 A moment later, he re−appeared upon the upper platform, with the gypsy still in his arms, still running madly, still crying, "Sanctuary!" and the throng applauded. 
 This flight from nature, life, himself, man, God, everything, lasted all day long. 
 At the corner of the Rue de la Barillerie, there was a grocer's shop whose porch was garnished all about, according to immemorial custom, with hoops of tin from which hung a circle of wooden candles, which came in contact with each other in the wind, and rattled like castanets. 
 Bark, Grève, grumble, Grève! Spin, spin, my distaff, spin her rope for the hangman, who is whistling in the meadow. 
 Grumble, Grève, bark, Grève! 
 The crescent of the moon, in her flight upward from the horizon, had paused at the moment, on the summit of the light hand tower, and seemed to have perched itself, like a luminous bird, on the edge of the balustrade, cut out in black trefoils. 
 The long windows of the choir showed the upper extremities of their arches above the black draperies, and their painted panes, traversed by a ray of moonlight had no longer any hues but the doubtful colors of night, a sort of violet, white and blue, whose tint is found only on the faces of the dead. 
 All at once, a gust of wind extinguished his lamp, and almost at the same instant, he beheld a shade, a whiteness, a form, a woman, appear from the opposite angle of the tower. 
 In this way he retreated once more beneath the gloomy arch of the stairway. 
 Every city during the Middle Ages, and every city in France down to the time of Louis XII. had its places of asylum. 
 His foot once within the asylum, the criminal was sacred; but he must beware of leaving it; one step outside the sanctuary, and he fell back into the flood. 
 Hence, condemned men were to be seen whose hair had grown white in a cloister, on the steps of a palace, in the enclosure of an abbey, beneath the porch of a church; in this manner the asylum was a prison as much as any other. 
 The gypsy raised her eyes to thank him, but she could not articulate a word. 
 Evening came, she thought the night so beautiful that she made the circuit of the elevated gallery which surrounds the church. 
 She was outside the pale of society, outside the pale of life, but she had a vague feeling that it might not be impossible to return to it. 
 She felt the terrible images which had so long persecuted her, gradually departing. 
 But, after all, she must not be too angry with him for it; had she not confessed her crime? had she not yielded, weak woman that she was, to torture? 
 She should have allowed her finger nails to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrenched from her. 
 The solemn lines of that architecture, the religious attitude of all the objects which surrounded the young girl, the serene and pious thoughts which emanated, so to speak, from all the pores of that stone, acted upon her without her being aware of it. 
 She did not wish to pain him, and resumed her lay, trembling all over. 
 By degrees, however, her terror disappeared, and she yielded herself wholly to the slow and melancholy air which she was singing. He remained on his knees with hands clasped, as in prayer, attentive, hardly breathing, his gaze riveted upon the gypsy's brilliant eyes. 
 On another occasion, he came to her with an awkward and timid air. "Listen," he said, with an effort; "I have something to say to you." 
 She made him a sign that she was listening. Then he began to sigh, half opened his lips, appeared for a moment to be on the point of speaking, then he looked at her again, shook his head, and withdrew slowly, with his brow in his hand, leaving the gypsy stupefied. 
 Phoebus!" Her voice, her face, her gesture, her whole person bore the heartrending expression of a shipwrecked man who is making a signal of distress to the joyous vessel which is passing afar off in a ray of sunlight on the horizon. 
 "Oh! there he is alighting from his horse! 
 He made her a sad sign with his head; then he planted his back against one of the stone posts of the Gondelaurier porch, determined to wait until the captain should come forth. 
 It is true that the night was very dark, that la Esmeralda, if she had remained at her post (and he had no doubt of this), was very far away, and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish the lovers on the balcony. 
 "Look here, do you come from the other world?" And he laid his hand on the hilt of his dagger. 
 He emphasized the words "some one," and loosing the horse's bridle,−− "Begone!" Phoebus spurred on in all haste, swearing. 
 At the most she occasionally caught a glimpse at the summit of the towers, of the bellringer's face turned sadly to her. But as soon as she perceived him, he disappeared. 
 He was the witness of a thousand little scenes between the gypsy and the deaf man, the pantomime of which, viewed from afar and commented on by his passion, appeared very tender to him. 
 As soon as he learned that the gypsy was alive, the cold ideas of spectre and tomb which had persecuted him for a whole day vanished, and the flesh returned to goad him. 
 He released her. "Vilify me, strike me, be malicious! 
 "Love me! love me! pity!" cried the poor priest returning her blows with caresses. 
 All at once, as she struggled and crawled on the floor, the gypsy's hand came in contact with something cold and metal− lic−it was Quasimodo's whistle. 
 From the angular imprint of that knee he recognized Quasimodo; but what was to be done? how could he make the other recognize him? the darkness rendered the deaf man blind. 
 Then she added with a pitiless expression, well aware that she was about to pierce the priest's heart with thousands of red−hot irons,−− "Ah! 
 As soon as Pierre Gringoire had seen how this whole affair was turning, and that there would decidedly be the rope, hanging, and other disagreeable things for the principal personages in this comedy, he had not cared to identify himself with the matter further. 
 It was a long time since he had seen the archdeacon, and Dom Claude was one of those solemn and impassioned men, a meeting with whom always upsets the equilibrium of a sceptical philosopher. 
 "Do you not think that the dress of those cavaliers whom we have just seen is far handsomer than yours and mine?" Gringoire tossed his head. 
 I prefer to be the head of a fly rather than the tail of a lion." 
 "I will tell you more," cried Dom Claude; and his voice, hitherto low, slow, and almost indistinct, turned to thunder. "She has in fact, taken refuge in Notre−Dame. 
 Gringoire listened to him at first with an undecided air, then he became touched, and wound up with a grimace which made his pallid face resemble that of a new−born infant with an attack of the colic. 
 "You are pathetic!" said he, wiping away a tear. 
 And then, if they do hang me,−−well! the halter is as good a death as any. 
 I beg to say that a luminous inspiration has just occurred to me. 
 But I have no more ink and I must buy some; I have no more paper, I have no more books, and I must buy some. 
 For this purpose, I am greatly in need of a little money, and I come to you, brother, with my heart full of contrition." 
 At the moment when he was passing through the courtyard of the cloister, beneath his brother's window, he heard that window open, raised his eyes and beheld the archdeacon's severe head emerge. 
 The reader has probably not forgotten that a part of the Cour de Miracles was enclosed by the ancient wall which surrounded the city, a goodly number of whose towers had begun, even at that epoch, to fall to ruin. 
 There were a few tallow dips lighted on the tables; but the real luminary of this tavern, that which played the part in this dram−shop of the chandelier of an opera house, was the fire. 
 The very children were arming themselves, and there were even cripples in bowls who, in armor and cuirass, made their way between the legs of the drinkers, like great beetles. 
 Listen to me, my friends; I am a vagabond to the bottom of my heart, I am a member of the slang thief gang in my soul, I was born an independent thief. 
 Fool! ~Non cuiquam datum est habere nasum~−−not every one is favored with a nose. 
 I swear to you, comrades. That I will drink no spiced and honeyed wine for a year, if I am lying now. 
 Old woman! 
 May the devil confound you!−−A fine hostelry of Beelzebub, where the hussies comb their heads with the forks! 
 And by the blood of God, I have neither faith nor law, nor fire nor dwelling−place, nor king nor God. 
 Gringoire, torn from his meditations, began to watch the wild and noisy scene which surrounded him, muttering between his teeth: "~Luxuriosa res vinum et tumultuosa ebrietas~. 
 At this word, which produced the effect of the call to boot and saddle on a regiment at a halt, all the outcasts, men, women, children, rushed in a mass from the tavern, with great noise of arms and old iron implements. 
 Quasimodo no longer saw any light with the exception of one window in a distant edifice, whose vague and sombre profile was outlined well above the roofs, in the direction of the Porte Sainte−Antoine. 
 The streets were invested, the church backed on the river. 
 Only, he presumed that it must be making very little noise, since the windows on the Place remained closed. 
 The base of this triangle rested on the back of the Place in such a manner as to bar the entrance of the Rue du Parvis; one of its sides faced Hôtel−Dieu, the other the Rue Saint−Pierre−aux−Boeufs. 
 In Paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty−one lords who laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to a manor and to administering justice, from the Bishop of Paris, who had five hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre− Dame des Champs, who had four. 
 Hence, in this disorder, deeds of violence on the part of the populace directed against a palace, a hotel, or house in the most thickly populated quarters, were not unheard−of occurrences. 
 That is why we call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church, or we will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church, which will be a good thing. 
 That done, the King of Thunes turned round and cast his eyes over his army, a fierce multitude whose glances flashed almost equally with their pikes. 
 "The devil! 'tis hard and obstinate!" said one. "It is old, and its gristles have become bony," said another. 
 "Call the moon the friend of the Virgin, after that!" went on Francois Chanteprune. 
 The vagabonds recovered their courage; soon the heavy joist, raised like a feather by two hundred vigorous arms, was flung with fury against the great door which they had tried to batter down. 
 The reader has no doubt divined that this unexpected resistance which had exasperated the outcasts came from Quasimodo. 
 Then he stooped and rose, stooped and rose again with incredible activity. 
 The panels cracked, the carved work flew into splinters, the hinges, at every blow, leaped from their pins, the planks yawned, the wood crumbled to powder, ground between the iron sheathing. 
 On the crest of the highest gallery, higher than the central rose window, there was a great flame rising between the two towers with whirlwinds of sparks, a vast, disordered, and furious flame, a tongue of which was borne into the smoke by the wind, from time to time. 
 There were griffins which had the air of laughing, gargoyles which one fancied one heard yelping, salamanders which puffed at the fire, tarasques* which sneezed in the smoke. 
 In the meanwhile, the principal vagabonds had retired beneath the porch of the Gondelaurier mansion, and were holding a council of war. 
 "I have it," replied Jehan, panting. 
 At the sight of this line of cuirassed backs, undulating as they rose through the gloom, one would have pronounced it a serpent with steel scales, which was raising itself erect in front of the church. 
 He had just caught sight of Quasimodo concealed in the dark, with flashing eye, behind one of the statues of the kings. 
 The arrow broken, Quasimodo breathing heavily, bounded like a grasshopper, and he fell upon the scholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow. 
 The great chamber five toises* square, which he had at the Louvre, with its huge chimney−piece loaded with twelve great beasts and thirteen great prophets, and his grand bed, eleven feet by twelve, pleased him but little. 
 On this table stood an inkhorn spotted with ink, some parchments, severalpens, and a large goblet of chased silver. A little further on was a brazier, a praying stool in crimson velvet, relieved with small bosses of gold. 
 The shield was flanked, on the right by an olive branch, on the left by a deer's antlers. 
 A groom of the stables and his two aids at four and twenty livres a month! 
 "Master Olivier, the princes who reign over great lordships, like kings and emperors, should not allow sumptuousness in their houses; for the fire spreads thence through the province. 
 In '81, sixty−six thousand six hundred and eighty livres, and this year, by the faith of my body, it will reach eighty thousand livres! 
 This was one of those fits of wrath which are allowed to take their course. 
 "'Tis like that request in Latin from the gentlemen of France, that we should re−establish what they call the grand charges of the Crown! 
 "Do you see, Gossip Guillaume? the grand warden of the keys, the grand butler, the grand chamberlain, the grand seneschal are not worth the smallest valet. 
 They serve no purpose, as they stand thus useless round the king; they produce upon me the effect of the four Evangelists who surround the face of the big clock of the palace, and which Philippe Brille has just set in order afresh. 
 "To Adam Tenon, clerk of the warden of the seals of the provostship of Paris; for the silver, making, and engraving of said seals, which have been made new because the others preceding, by reason of their antiquity and their worn condition, could no longer be successfully used, twelve livres parisis. 
 "During this year there have been made by the ordinance of justice, to the sound of the trumpet, through the squares of Paris, fifty−six proclamations. 
 In the days of the pagans of Jupiter, when the people offered the temples a hundred oxen and a hundred sheep, the emperors gave a hundred lions and a hundred eagles. 
 "Surely! the Germans are so great and powerful, that it is hardly credible−−But let us not forget the old proverb: 'The finest county is Flanders; the finest duchy, Milan; the finest kingdom, France.' 
 "What is this?" be said, "Complaints and fault finding against our garrisons in Picardy! Olivier, write with diligence to M. the Marshal de Rouault:−−That discipline is relaxed. 
 All at once he broke out explosively, "~Pasque−Dieu~!" What people are those who claim to be voyers, justiciaries, lords and masters in our domains? who have their tollgates at the end of every field? their gallows and their hangman at every cross−road among our people? 
 Then casting about him once more the cautious and uneasy glance of the fox re−entering his hole,−− "No matter! we will succor monsieur the bailiff. 
 "What were you going to do in this damnable sedition?" The outcast stared at the king, and swung his arms with a stupid air. 
 He had one of those awkwardly shaped heads where intelligence is about as much at its ease as a light beneath an extinguisher. 
 Tristan l'Hermite bowed. He gave an order in a low voice to two archers, who led away the poor vagabond. 
 "How do you permit yourself, knave, to go and besiege our friend, monsieur the bailiff of the palace, and what have you to say concerning this popular agitation?" 
 "Phew!" replied the king, "I see no objection." 
 Sire, you are an august and, very puissant monarch; have pity on a poor man who is honest, and who would find it more difficult to stir up a revolt than a cake of ice would to give out a spark! 
 These, sire, are my maxims of state: then do not judge me to be a seditious and thieving rascal because my garment is worn at the elbows. 
 When Gringoire paused at last, quite out of breath, he raised his head tremblingly towards the king, who was engaged in scratching a spot on the knee of his breeches with his finger− nail; then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of ptisan. 
 and that I have a nephew." "I give the receivership to your nephew, Gossip Jacques," replied the king; "but draw this fire from my breast." 
 "I am at the end of my finances," pursued the doctor; and it would really be a pity that the house should not have a roof; not on account of the house, which is simple and thoroughly bourgeois, but because of the paintings of Jehan Fourbault, which adorn its wainscoating. 
 Never were seen more amorous eyes, more rounded limbs, a nobler air, or a more gracefully flowing skirt. 
 "Am I to have my roof?" said Coictier. 
 Jacques Coictier bowed low and said,−− "Sire, it is a repellent which will save you. 
 "He was councillor to the king in the matter of the courts of the treasury." 
 We have been good enough to change your name of Le Mauvais (The Evil), which resembled your face too closely. 
 Louis XI. far from being irritated by this petulant insult, resumed with some gentleness, "Stay, I was forgetting that I made you my ambassador to Madame Marie, at Ghent. 
 Our readers have not, without doubt, waited until the present moment to recognize in Master Olivier that terrible Figaro whom Providence, the great maker of dramas, mingled so artistically in the long and bloody comedy of the reign of Louis XI. 
 And Louis XI.'s glance was almost as joyous as that of the hosier. "Will it not be difficult to resist?" 
 But Advoyer Scharnachtal hurled himself on the handsome duke with his battle−club and his people, and when the glittering Burgundian army came in contact with these peasants in bull hides, it flew in pieces like a pane of glass at the blow of a pebble. 
 And I will gain the upper hand of it as soon as it shall please me to frown." The other replied indifferently,−− "That may be, sire; in that case, 'tis because the people's hour hath not yet come." 
 Guillaume Rym considered it incumbent on him to intervene,−− 
 Then, laying his hand familiarly on Coppenole's shoulder,−− "You were saying, Master Jacques?" 
 And turning with an abrupt gesture towards the sturdy Fleming,−− "Have you never seen a revolt, Master Jacques?" 
 "How do you set to work to make a revolt?" said the king. 
 "Ah!" replied Coppenole, "'tis not very difficult. 
 This question caused the king to meditate. 
 He ran distractedly along the gallery. 
 All at once, a great galloping of horses filled the neighboring streets, and, with a long file of torches and a thick column of cavaliers, with free reins and lances in rest, these furious sounds debouched on the Place like a hurricane,−− 
 He advanced thus into the very thickest of the cavalry, with the tranquil slowness, the lolling of the head and the regular breathing of a harvester attacking a field of wheat. 
 She had sat up, she had listened, she had looked; then, terrified by the light and noise, she had rushed from her cell to see. 
 Our readers are aware that the Terrain was a tongue of land enclosed by walls on the side of the City and belonging to the chapter of Notre−Dame, which terminated the island on the east, behind the church. 
 There was here less tumult in the air. The roar of the outcasts' assault reached them more confusedly and less clamorously. 
 I possess philosophy by instinct, by nature, ~ut apes geometriam~. 
 There is a chapel crowned with a small vault full of very well carved enrichments. 
 Adultery is a prying into the pleasures of others−−Ohé! the noise yonder is redoubling!" 
 All at once, a hundred torches, the light of which glittered upon the helmets of men at arms, spread over the church at all heights, on the towers, on the galleries, on the flying buttresses. 
 They arrived thus, still keeping along the quay, at a tolerably spacious square. 
 He looked like the ghost of himself; that is an effect of the moonlight, it seems as though one beheld only the spectres of things in that light. 
 The priest remained motionless, his finger still raised toward the gibbet, preserving his attitude like a statue. 
 Alas! young girl, night and day−−yes, night and day I tell you,−−it is torture. Oh! 
 You are radiant with the most beautiful mildness; you are wholly sweet, good, pitiful, and charming. Alas! 
 Oh! what desertion of all virtue! What desperate abandonment of myself! 
 All at once the recluse exclaimed, as though the gypsy's question had taken all this time to reach her brain,−−"'What have you done to me?' you say! 
 Well! listen.−−I had a child! you see! 
 It is so innocent a thing!−−Well! that, that is what they took from me, what they killed. 
 To−day, it is my turn; I am going to eat the gypsy.−−Oh! 
 I would bite you well, if the bars did not prevent me! 
 "Give me back my little Agnes!" pursued Gudule. 
 Then she went to seek in the corner of her cell a huge paving stone, which served her as a pillow, and launched it against them with such violence that one of the bars broke, emitting thousands of sparks. 
 She remained silent for a moment; but she paced the cell hurriedly, and halted now and then to pluck out handfuls of her gray hairs, which she afterwards tore with her teeth. 
 The commander dismounted, and came toward her. 
 "How long ago, say you, did the cart do it?" 
 "A month, a fortnight, perhaps, monseigheur, I know not." 
 The poor child had remained all this time in her corner, without breathing, without moving, with the idea of death before her. 
 She began to shake her head, crying,−− "There is no one! there is no one! there is no one!" 
 I have no wish to harm you." She said, with a strange sneer,−− "Ah! so you have no wish to harm me!" 
 Rennet Cousin went in search of the chest of tools for the night man, under the shed of the Pillar−House. 
 "~Tête Dieu~!" continued Tristan, "why do you try to prevent this sorceress being hung as it pleases the king?" 
 The recluse had gone and seated herself by her daughter, covering her with her body, in front of her, with staring eyes, listening to the poor child, who did not stir, but who kept murmuring in a low voice, these words only, "Phoebus! 
 Do not you understand that this woman tells you that she is my daughter? 
 Eh! lynx, have you never lain with your female? have you never had a cub? and if you have little ones, when they howl have you nothing in your vitals that moves?" 
 The crowbars raised the heavy course. It was, as we have said, the mother's last bulwark. 
 I ask nothing of any one; I am from Reims, gentlemen; I own a little field inherited from my uncle, Mahiet Pradon. 
 I want to go away! we want to go away! and when two women pass, one a mother and the other a daughter, one lets them go! 
 Then he bent down to the ear of Rennet Cousin, and said to him in a very low tone,−− 
 Only at a distance, at the summit of that one of the towers of Notre−Dame which commands the Grève, two men outlined in black against the light morning sky, and who seemed to be looking on, were visible. 
 Rennet Cousin paused at the foot of the fatal ladder, with that which he was dragging, and, barely breathing, with so much pity did the thing inspire him, he passed the rope around the lovely neck of the young girl. The unfortunate child felt the horrible touch of the hemp. 
 She raised her eyelids, and saw the fleshless arm of the stone gallows extended above her head. 
 The executioner, who had not loosed his hold on the young girl, began to ascend the ladder once more. 
 When the fatigue of finding nothing had disheartened Tristan, who was not easily discouraged, Quasimodo continued the search alone. 
 Here the stroke of a bell, there the stroke of a hammer, beyond, the complicated clatter of a cart in motion. 
 Already several columns of smoke were being belched forth from the chimneys scattered over the whole surface of roofs, as through the fissures of an immense sulphurous crater. 
 In the Parvis, some good women, who had their milk jugs in their hands, were pointing out to each other, with astonishment, the singular dilapidation of the great door of Notre−Dame, and the two solidified streams of lead in the crevices of the stone. 
 But the priest was not listening to, was not looking at, anything of all this. 
 Only, and this was also one way of interrogating the archdeacon, he followed the direction of his vision, and in this way the glance of the unhappy deaf man fell upon the Place de Grève. 
 He merely writhed upon the spout, with incredible efforts to climb up again; but his hands had no hold on the granite, his feet slid along the blackened wall without catching fast. 
 Quasimodo had but to stretch out his hand in order to draw him from the gulf; but he did not even look at him. He was looking at the Grève. 
 The miserable man said to himself that, when his hands should be worn out with fatigue, when his cassock should tear asunder, when the lead should give way, he would be obliged to fall, and terror seized upon his very vitals. 
 The archdeacon, seeing that all his exertions served only to weaken the fragile support which remained to him, decided to remain quiet. 
 All was stone around him; before his eyes, gaping monsters; below, quite at the bottom, in the Place, the pavement; above his head, Quasimodo weeping. 
 The priest heard them saying, for their voices reached him, clear and shrill: "Why, he will break his neck!" 
 No one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their compact, Quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off Claude Frollo, that is to say, the sorcerer. 
 It appears that, after having tasted astrology, philosophy, architecture, hermetics,−−all vanities, he returned to tragedy, vainest pursuit of all. 
 Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook - Mrs. Grubach was his landlady - but today she didn't come. 
 "Anna should have brought me my breakfast," said K. He tried to work out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through observation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to be looked at for very long. 
 Instead he went over to the door, opened it slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately behind it, "He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast." 
 "It would be the first time that's happened," said K., as he jumped out of bed and quickly pulled on his trousers. "I want to see who that is in the next room, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this way." 
 It immediately occurred to him that he needn't have said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have acknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the time. 
 "I want neither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you've introduced yourself." "I meant it for your own good," said the stranger and opened the door, this time without being asked. 
 "And what is it you want, then?" said K., looking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named Franz, who had remained in the doorway. Through the open window he noticed the old woman again, who had come close to the window opposite so that she could continue to see everything. 
 It's not really part of my job to be friendly towards you like this, but I hope no-one, apart from Franz, will hear about it, and he's been more friendly towards you than he should have been, under the rules, himself. 
 If you carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting officers then you can reckon on things going well with you." 
 K. wanted to sit down, but then he saw that, apart from the chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he could sit. 
 The two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower quality, but that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes and return them to him if his case turned out well. 
 "It's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom," they said. "Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come to an end or not. 
 And cases like this can last a long time, especially the ones that have been coming up lately. 
 His strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and sharing an understanding with the other policeman. 
 What office did they belong to? K. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws were decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own home? 
 "That's true, you know, you'd better believe it," said Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood. 
 "And what do you want us to do about it?" replied the big policeman, loudly. "The way you're carrying on, it's worse than a child. 
 Do you want to get this great, bloody trial of yours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We're just coppers, that's all we are. 
 Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card from another, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it. That's all we are. 
 "It's probably exists only in your heads," said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts to his benefit or to make himself at home there. 
 K. stopped talking with them; do I, he thought to himself, do I really have to carry on getting tangled up with the chattering of base functionaries like this? - and they admit themselves that they are of the lowest position. 
 It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves. 
 I just need few words with someone of the same social standing as myself and everything will be incomparably clearer, much clearer than a long conversation with these two can make it. 
 K. had to put an end to this display, "Take me to your superior," he said. 
 Not before," said the policeman, the one called Willem. "And now my advice to you," he added, "is to go into your room, stay calm, and wait and see what's to be done with you. 
 If you take our advice, you won't tire yourself out thinking about things to no purpose, you need to pull yourself together as there's a lot that's going to required of you. 
 But in spite of all that we're still willing, if you've got the money, to go and get you some breakfast from the café over the road." 
 Now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway, as he confirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it was far better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the policemen from the dirty café. 
 If nobody believed him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could bring Mrs. Grubach in as a witness, or even the old pair from across the street, who probably even now were on their way over to the window opposite. 
 It puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking at it from the policemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and left him alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself. 
 At the same time, though, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so. 
 Maybe, if the policemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental abilities, it could have been supposed that they had come to the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of it. 
 "What d'you think you're doing?" they cried. "Think you're going to see the supervisor dressed in just your shirt, do you? 
 He'd see to it you got a right thumping, and us and all!" 
 "Let go of me for God's sake!" called K., who had already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe, "if you accost me when I'm still in bed you can't expect to find me in my evening dress." 
 "That won't help you," said the policemen, who always became very quiet, almost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way confused him or, to some extent, brought him to his senses. 
 K. knew very well that this room had recently been let to a typist called 'Miss Bürstner'. She was in the habit of going out to work very early and coming back home very late, and K. had never exchanged more than a few words of greeting with her. 
 Now, her bedside table had been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these proceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it. 
 At the window across the street, there was the old pair again, although now their number had increased, as behind them, and far taller than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed his chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers. 
 "Certainly," said K., and he began to feel relaxed now that, at last, he stood in front of someone with some sense, someone with whom he would be able to talk about his situation. "Certainly I'm surprised, but I'm not in any way very surprised." 
 "What I mean is...," said K. without delaying a second time, "that, yes, I am very surprised but when you've been in the world for thirty years already and had to make your own way through everything yourself, which has been my lot, then you become hardened to surprises and don't take them too hard. 
 "I wouldn't want to say that I see all of this as a joke, you seem to have gone to too much trouble making all these arrangements for that. 
 Everyone in the house must be taking part in it as well as all of you, that would be going beyond what could be a joke. 
 "But on the other hand," K. went on, looking round at everyone there and even wishing he could get the attention of the three who were looking at the photographs, "on the other hand this really can't be all that important. 
 I require a clear answer to all these questions, and I'm quite sure that once things have been made clear we can take our leave of each other on the best of terms." 
 "You're making a big mistake," he said. "These gentlemen and I have got nothing to do with your business, in fact we know almost nothing about you. 
 We could be wearing uniforms as proper and exact as you like and your situation wouldn't be any the worse for it. 
 As to whether you're on a charge, I can't give you any sort of clear answer to that, I don't even know whether you are or not. 
 You're under arrest, you're quite right about that, but I don't know any more than that. 
 And stop making all this fuss about your sense of innocence; you don't make such a bad impression, but with all this fuss you're damaging it. And you ought to do a bit less talking, too. 
 And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him? He became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down. 
 You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be? 
 "You can call him if you want to," said the supervisor, stretching his had out towards the outer room where the telephone was, "please, go on, do make your phone call." 
 Across the street, the people were still there at the window, and it was only now that K. had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going on. 
 The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that was what he saw from the corner of his eye. 
 "Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it," he said to K. as he did so, "so you think we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do you. 
 Mind you, on the other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope for you. 
 That's enough for one day and we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at least. 
 K. stood where he was and watched them through the open double doorway, the last to go, of course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot. 
 At that moment Mrs. Grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the people were. She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all, and K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for no reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body. 
 Once downstairs, K., with his watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi - he had already been delayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any longer. 
 Inside the taxi, K. remembered that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving - the supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor. 
 Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could. 
 There were, however, also exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. was invited by the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his industry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to eat dinner with him at his large house. 
 K. had called each of them, separately or all together, into his office that day for no other reason than to observe them; he was always satisfied and had always been able to let them go again. 
 At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of the building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was standing there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe. 
 "A woman's hands will do many things when no-one's looking," he thought, he might himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly would not have been able to carry it all out. 
 "There's a lot of work to do," she said, "during the day I belong to the tenants; if I'm to sort out my own things there are only the evenings left to me." 
 An old woman is the only person I can speak about it with. "But it must have caused some work for you," he said then, "but it won't happen again." 
 As you're being so honest with me, Mr. K., I can admit to you that I listened to a little of what was going on from behind the door, and that those two policemen told me one or two things as well. 
 But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talk about it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman, thought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement. 
 But now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to be confirmed with a handshake. " 
 "I didn't know I was taking it hard," said K., feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree with him it was of very little value. 
 I certainly wouldn't want to say anything nasty about Miss Bürstner, she is a good, sweet girl, friendly, tidy, punctual, works hard, I appreciate all that very much, but one thing is true, she ought to have more pride, be a bit less forthcoming. 
 I really don't like saying this, you're the only one I've said this to, Mr. K., I swear to God, but I'm going to have no choice but to have a few words with Miss Bürstner about it myself. 
 "Mrs. Grubach, you are on quite the wrong track ," said K., so angry that he was hardly able to hide it, "and you have moreover misunderstood what I was saying about Miss Bürstner, that is not what I meant. 
 And what's more, perhaps I'm going to far, I don't want to get in your way, say to her whatever you see fit. 
 "Decent!" called out K. through the crack in the door, "if you want to keep the house decent you'll first have to give me notice." Then he slammed the door shut, there was a gentle knocking to which he paid no more attention. 
 He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss Bürstner would arrive home. 
 As he lay there by the window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even thought for a moment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuading Miss Bürstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would. 
 K. did as he was told, and then even waited until Miss Bürstner came out of her room and quietly invited him, once more, to come in. 
 "I expect you'll say," K. began, "that the matter really isn't all that urgent and we don't need to talk about it right now, but ..." 
 K. nodded, and quietly cursed Kaminer who worked at his bank and who was always active doing things that had neither use nor purpose. 
 "Well now, innocent ... " said the lady, "I don't want to start making any pronouncements that might have serious consequences, I don't really know you after all, it means they're dealing with a serious criminal if they send an investigating committee straight out to get him. 
 More than I know, in fact, as it actually wasn't even an investigating committee, that's just what I called them because I don't know what else to call them. 
 "What's too vague?" asked K. Then he remembered himself and asked, "Would you like me to show you what it was like?" He wanted to move in some way but did not want to leave. 
 "You arrived back so late," said K. "Now you've started telling me off. 
 Well I suppose I deserve it as I shouldn't have let you in here in the first place, and it turns out there wasn't even any point." 
 "Oh, there was a point, you'll see now how important a point it was," said K. "May I move this table away from your bedside and put it here?" 
 Ah yes, I'm forgetting myself, the most important person of all, so I'm standing here in front of the table. the supervisor is sitting extremely comfortably with his legs crossed and his arm hanging over the backrest here like some layabout. 
 And now it really does begin. the supervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up, in fact he shouts at me, I'm afraid, if I'm to make it clear to you, I'll have to shout as well, and it's nothing more than my name that he shouts out." 
 "Yes they do," whispered Miss Bürstner into K.'s ear, "a nephew of Mrs. Grubach's, an captain in the army, has been sleeping there since yesterday. 
 "I won't go," said K., "until you've calmed down a bit. Come over into the other corner of the room, he won't be able to hear us there." 
 She let him lead her there. "Don't forget," he said, "although this might be unpleasant for you you're not in any real danger. 
 You know how much esteem Mrs. Grubach has for me, she's the one who will make all the decisions in this, especially as the captain is her nephew, but she believes everything I say without question. 
 If you wish to let it be known that I have attacked you then Mrs. Grubach will be informed of such and she will believe it without even losing her trust in me, that's how much respect she has for me." 
 It was all so quiet after you'd shouted, and then there was the knocking, that's was made me so shocked, and I was sitting right by the door, the knocking was right next to me. 
 She gave him a tired nod, offered him her hand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she was doing, and went back into her room with her head bowed. 
 On the one hand it was in everyone's interest to bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other hand every aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly without lasting too long because of the associated stress. 
 For these reasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations following on one after another. 
 It was a matter of course that he would have to appear without fail, there was probably no need to point this out to him. 
 He would be given the number of the building where he was to present himself, which was in a street in a suburb well away from the city centre which K. had never been to before. 
 Once he had received this notice, K. hung up the receiver without giving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, it was certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up to it, and this first examination would probably also be the last. 
 He was still standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of the deputy director behind him - he wanted to use the telephone but K. stood in his way. 
 "Bad news?" asked the deputy director casually, not in order to find anything out but just to get K. away from the device. 
 "No, no, " said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely. 
 He was only speaking at the side of the telephone receiver while he waited for his connection, but in giving this invitation the deputy director was humbling himself. 
 It was only when the deputy director hung up that he was shocked into awareness and said, in order to partially excuse his standing there for no reason, 
 K. forced himself to answer, but his thoughts were mainly about that Sunday, how it would be best to get there for nine o'clock in the morning as that was the time that courts always start work on weekdays. 
 Oddly enough, although he had little time to look around him, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case, Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer. 
 Anyway, now he was running so that he would get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he had no appointment for this time. 
 K. had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but when he stood at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of almost nothing but monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats occupied by poor people. 
 It was a long street, and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level, selling various kinds of foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a few steps. 
 Just then, a gramophone, which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn out, began to play some murderous tune. 
 K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of time now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one of the windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there. 
 The building was quite far down the street, it covered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in particular was tall and long. 
 It was clearly intended for delivery wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knew from his work at the bank. 
 It irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the room, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or especially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very loudly and very unambiguously. 
 In the end he decided to climb up the stairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the policeman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by the guilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway that K. selected by chance. 
 "That's right," K. would say, although it was clear that the investigating committee was not to be found there, and so his task was at an end. 
 K. eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to be led all round from floor to floor in this way. 
 As he reached the fifth floor, he decided to give up the search, took his leave of a friendly, young worker who wanted to lead him on still further and went down the stairs. 
 K. would probably not have followed her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door handle and said, "I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else will be allowed in." 
 He passed through between two men who were talking beside the door - one of them held both hands far out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money, the other looked him closely in the eyes - and someone took him by the hand. It was a small, red-faced youth. 
 Most of them were dressed in black, in old, long, formal frock coats that hung down loosely around them. 
 These clothes were the only thing that puzzled K., as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for a local political meeting. 
 From time to time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone. 
 It was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention to the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it was he quietly said. 
 Many of them had brought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so that they would not hurt themselves pressed against it. 
 K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did not defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, "Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now." There followed loud applause, once more from the right hand side of the hall. 
 He wondered what he could say to get all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible, to at least get the support of the others for a while. 
 "Yes," said the man, "but I'm now no longer under any obligation to hear your case" - there was once more a muttering, but this time it was misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his hand and continued - "I will, however, as an exception, continue with it today. 
 He stood pressed closely against the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great that he had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge's desk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it. 
 "Now then," said the judge, thumbing through the book. He turned to K. with the tone of someone who knows his facts and said, "you are a house painter?" 
 This reply was followed by laughter among the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty that K. couldn't stop himself joining in with it. 
 The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power over those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until then hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and bushy over his eyes. 
 The people in the left faction were not only fewer in number than the right but probably were no more important than them, although their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they were. 
 "Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter - in fact even more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed it on me - is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are being carried out. 
 I don't say things are being done without due care but I would like to make it clear that it is I who make the acknowledgement." 
 It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but everything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would follow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of activity that would bring this whole affair to an end. 
 It was somewhat disturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, the young washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and, despite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the people there. 
 Every one of them was an old man, some of them with white beards. 
 Could they perhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way or the other? They had sunk into a state of motionlessness while K. gave his oration, and it had not been possible to raise them from this passivity even when the judge was being humiliated. 
 Not even K. thought him of any importance but it did raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority of them began to think about the matter and if only one of them, now and then, was persuaded. 
 I'm sure the examining judge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his job after all. 
 They came for me in the morning when I was still in bed. Maybe the order had been given to arrest some house painter - that seems possible after what the judge has said - someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose. 
 This was the room of a lady who I have a lot of respect for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and the policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not through any fault of mine. 
 It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed to do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was that I was under arrest. If he were here he would have to confirm what I say. 
 In fact he had done more than that and brought three junior employees from the bank where I work into the lady's room; they had made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged to the lady and causing a mess. 
 There was, of course, another reason for bringing these employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid, were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public reputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank. 
 K. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing. As he did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give a sign to someone in the crowd. 
 It really doesn't matter to me, and I give his lordship the judge my full and public permission to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate down there and give his orders in words instead; let him just say "Boo now!," and then the next time "Clap now!". 
 Below them in the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly. 
 The two factions had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to each other but now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointed up at K., others pointed at the judge. 
 The air in the room was fuggy and extremely oppressive, those who were standing furthest away could hardly even be seen through it. 
 It must have been especially troublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery, as they were forced to quietly ask the participants in the assembly what exactly was happening, albeit with timid glances at the judge. 
 The replies they received were just as quiet, and given behind the protection of a raised hand. 
 "I have nearly finished what I have to say," said K., and as there was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each other. 
 "Non of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calm assessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real importance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I have to say. 
 If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to write it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll soon be leaving." 
 That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of those they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of people they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial. 
 The policemen only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those they arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won possessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers." 
 K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the smoke whitish and hard to see through. 
 But it was not her who was screaming, but the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling. 
 On the contrary, they stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of his collar. 
 K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped down from the podium. 
 Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must follow, were they tired of pretending? 
 Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws, not as if they were taking hold of their own beards. 
 As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges. 
 All of them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap. 
 He briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit. 
 "You bunch of louts," he called, "you can keep all your hearings as a present from me," then opened the door and hurried down the steps. 
 Behind him, the noise of the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them. 
 So on Sunday, he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door. 
 It was opened as soon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen last time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight into the adjoining room when she said to him "There's no session today". 
 On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before with a few books laying on it. 
 "I see," said K., and nodded, "those books must be law books, and that's how this court does things, not only to try people who are innocent but even to try them without letting them know what's going on." 
 The woman saw how surprised he was and said, "Yes, we're allowed to live here as we like, only we have to clear the room out when the court's in session. 
 "There's no-one I know who'd hold it against me," said the woman. "Him, who put his arms around me, he's been chasing after me for a long time. 
 I've got no protection from him, even my husband has had to get used to it; if he wants to keep his job he's got to put up with it as that man's a student and he'll almost certainly be very powerful later on. 
 "Do you want to make things a bit better here?" the woman asked slowly, watching him as if she were saying something that could be as dangerous for K. as for herself. 
 I really would not have become involved in this matter if I could have helped it, and I would have lost no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better. 
 But because I'm told that I have been arrested - and I am under arrest - it forces me to take some action, and to do so for my own sake. 
 And I will be glad to do so not only for the sake of charity but also because you can be of some help to me." 
 The books were old and well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its middle, and it was held together with a few threads. 
 K. took hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent picture appeared. 
 "So this is the sort of law book they study here," said K., "this is the sort of person sitting in judgement over me." 
 "I don't think you can be of any assistance to me," he said, "to be of any real assistance you would need to be in contact with high officials. 
 I'm sure you're very familiar with them and could achieve a great deal through them, I've no doubt of that, but the most that could be done through them would have no bearing at all on the final outcome of the trial. 
 You, on the other hand, would lose some of your friends as a result, and I have no wish of that. 
 Carry on with these people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem to me to be something you cannot do without. 
 All I meant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my behalf in the proceedings against me. 
 But even that is nothing for you to worry about when you consider that there's nothing hanging on the outcome of this trial, and that, whatever the verdict, I will just laugh at it. 
 I think it's much more likely that the court officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even to fearful ever to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be abandoned if they haven't been abandoned already. 
 It's even possible that they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of receiving a large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be quite in vain as I pay bribes to no-one. 
 Everyone had gone, but the examining judge, he stayed in the hall, I had to bring him a lamp in, all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he was very satisfied with it and started to write straight away. 
 Meantime my husband arrived, he always has the day off on Sundays, we got the furniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the neighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit by a candle, in short, we forgot all about the examining judge and went to bed. 
 What I mean, with all this, I just wanted to tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports, especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main things on the agenda that Sunday. 
 K. looked at him with some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely attain high office one day. 
 He really was attracted to the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give in to her allure. 
 It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off. 
 And it would be empty because she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this lush, supple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy material belonged to him, totally to him and to him alone. 
 The student briefly looked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around her. 
 Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which K. had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him, 
 This comment could have caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K. also bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in speaking in this way. 
 I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge. 
 It's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking roughly - and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well." 
 "You're wasting your breath," said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and said, "come with me." 
 "So that's it," said the student, "oh no, you're not going to get her," and with a strength you would not have expected from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his back bent under the weight, ran with her to the door. 
 K. ran the few steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, 
 If he stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just with a kick. 
 Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden steps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so that it was not possible to see where they ended. 
 He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the examining judge. 
 Then K. noticed a small piece of paper next to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised hand, "Entrance to the Court Offices". Were the court offices here, in the attic of this tenement, then? 
 Going by K.'s experience of them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply in a state of poverty. 
 K. also now understood that the court was ashamed to summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial hearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes. 
 It was true, though, that he had no secondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm. 
 "I know that," said K. as he looked at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary buttons, displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and seemed to have been taken from an old army officer's coat. 
 It's Sunday today, and it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send me off with some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away from here. 
 Just here, just above the floor, that's where he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out, his fingers spread apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle and blood squirted out all around him. 
 "Nothing that I know of," said the usher. "And it's going to get even worse now, up till now he's only been carrying her off for himself, now he's started carrying her off for the judge and all, just like I'd always said he would." 
 And my wife is the best looking woman in the whole building, but it's me who's not even allowed to defend himself." 
 "Well why not?" asked the usher. "He's a coward that student, if he wants to lay a finger on my wife all you'd have to do is give him such a good hiding he'd never dare do it again. 
 But I'm not allowed to do that, and nobody else is going to do me the favour as they're all afraid of his power. 
 All of them were carelessly dressed although the expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to the upper classes. 
 There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the example of the others. 
 When those who were sitting nearest the door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up. 
 Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this help. 
 Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, "The gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for. 
 The voice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect than K.'s. 
 "I'm ... I'm waiting ..." he began, and then came to a halt. 
 Some of the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, "Get out the way, keep the gangway free." 
 In the meantime, the man whom K. had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him with a smile. 
 "A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my case, and I'm waiting for it to be settled." 
 Almost all of those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who, by now, had stopped shouted and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident. 
 The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself, saluted, and hurried on, walking with very short steps, probably because of gout. 
 K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people, especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that way. 
 "It's the only way there is," said the usher, who had now started to sound quite reproachful, "I can't go back with you again, I've got to hand in my report, and I've already lost a lot of time because of you as it is." 
 K. had still not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself, and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that he noticed it. 
 He had, after all, said that no-one would take any notice of K., and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few and everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as to why he was there. 
 And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as he watched. 
 K. looked at her as if to ask whose way they were impeding. "If you like, I can take you to the sick room," and turning to the man in the doorway said, "please help me". 
 He remembered the usher who, despite everything, would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed to have gone long before. K. looked out between the man and the young woman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher. 
 So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a little, I'm feeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up by myself." 
 He gives all the information they need to people who are waiting, as our court and its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked for quite a lot. 
 We, that's to say all of us who work in the offices here, we decided that the information-giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the litigants and he's the first one they meet, so he needs to give a dignified first impression. 
 "That's how it is," said the man, mocking her, "but I don't understand why it is that you're explaining all our intimate facts to the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're pressing them on him, as I'm sure he's not all interested. 
 It's not really his job to help litigants outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can see. 
 I don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like to be helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to give the impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. 
 "Would you not like to sit down here a while?" asked the information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just in front of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier. 
 K. felt almost ashamed to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by the information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead. 
 But the defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood there humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for being there. The information-giver looked past him. 
 He had said that with as decisively as he could, but in fact it would have done him a lot of good to sit down. 
 "Louder," he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at having to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough, even if it had been, for him, incomprehensible. 
 K. became aware that he was standing in front of the way out, and that the young woman had opened the door. 
 "Thank you very much," he repeated, shook their hands once more and did not let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the comparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the offices. 
 He did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did - and this was something on which he could advise himself - he wanted to spend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one. 
 It was still early when K. noticed, through the keyhole, that there was an unusual level of activity in the hallway which soon abated. 
 She could be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours, there was always another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she had forgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home. 
 K. did not look up at Mrs. Grubach, but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel some relief as she breathed in. 
 "We're not clearing anything out, Mr. K.," she said, "it's just that Miss Montag is moving in with Miss Bürstner and is moving her things across." 
 She said nothing more, but just waited to see how K. would take it and whether he would allow her to carry on speaking. 
 "Mr. K.," called Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for this very question, as she put her hands together and held them out towards him. 
 At this last outcry, Mrs. Grubach was already choking back her tears, she raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud. 
 "Well, yes, that's how it is," said K., and as Mrs. Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said nothing he dared to add, "Do you really think, then, that I'd want to make an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know?" 
 K. said nothing in reply, he should have chased her from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth, and he didn't want to do that. 
 Outside, the dragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from one side of the hallway to the other. 
 "Yes," said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, "I wanted to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she's stubborn, she wants to move everything in herself. 
 K. was irritated all the more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the outside, could have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part. 
 "But I get the impression you don't pay much attention to what's going on in the lodging house," said Miss Montag. 
 "That's how it is," said Miss Montag, " or rather, that's not at all how it is, the way you put it is remarkably severe. 
 Now my friend is aware of your reasons for asking for this meeting - or at least I suppose she is - and so, for reasons I know nothing about, she is quite sure that it would be of no benefit to anyone if this meeting actually took place. 
 I hope, however, also to have acted in your interests, as even the slightest uncertainty in the least significant of matters will always remain a cause of suffering and if, as in this case, it can be removed without substantial effort, then it is better if that is done without delay." 
 "I thank you," said K. as soon as Miss Montag had finished. He stood slowly up, looked at her, then across the table, then out the window - the house opposite stood there in the sun - and went to the door. 
 K. thought, however, that he saw more than that, he thought he also saw that Miss Montag had chosen a means of doing it that was good, but two-edged. 
 She would be disappointed, K. did not want to exaggerate anything, he was aware that Miss Bürstner was a little typist who would not offer him much resistance for long. 
 All these things were going through his mind as he left the room with hardly a polite word. 
 I've got a family to feed, and Franz here wanted to get married, you just have to get more money where you can, you can't do it just by working hard, not however hard you try. 
 "I didn't know about any of this that you've been telling me, and I made no sort of request that you be punished, I was simply acting on principle." 
 Look at him, look how fat he is - the first strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat. Do you know what it is that's made him so fat? 
 He's in the habit of, everyone that gets arrested by him, he eats their breakfast. 
 But a man with a belly like that can't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of the question." 
 "I would make it well worth your while if you would let them go," said K., and without looking at the whip-man again - as such matters are best carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down - he pulled out his wallet. 
 But that's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to me to let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or even that they might be punished, I would never have named them in the first place as they are not the ones I hold responsible. 
 "Yeah, that's all very plausible, what you're saying there," said the whip-man , "only I'm not the sort of person you can bribe. 
 Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me at the entrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful." 
 "I'm not going to wait any longer," said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in both hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner and looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head. 
 Then, the sudden scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it seemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was being tortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard by everyone in the building. 
 K tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the yard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. 
 And K. had not been ungenerous, he really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now begun to do something against the degeneracy of the court then it was a matter of course that he would have to do something here as well. 
 K. could not possibly have let the junior bank staff, and perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch him by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room. 
 In the distance, he heard the steps of the servitors; he did not want them to be too aware of his presence, so he closed the window and walked towards the main staircase. 
 As he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank, he looked carefully round at everyone who was passing, but there was no girl to be seen who might have been waiting for somebody, not even within some distance from the bank. 
 On the way home, as he passed by the junk room again, he opened its door as if that had been his habit. 
 Instead of the darkness he expected, he saw everything unchanged from the previous evening, and did not know how he should respond. 
 "Go and get that junk room cleared out!" he shouted, and, in amazement, they stopped what they were doing. "It should have been done long ago, we're sinking in dirt!" 
 One afternoon - K. was very busy at the time, getting the post ready - K.'s Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room, pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some papers. 
 K. had long expected his uncle to appear, but the sight of him now shocked K. far less than the prospect of it had done a long time before. 
 Uncle Karl was K.'s former guardian, and so K. was duty-bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed for the night. 'I'm haunted by a ghost from the country', he would say. 
 As soon as they had greeted each other - K. had invited him to sit in the armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that - he said he wanted to speak briefly with K. in private. 
 Like I said, they would not let me through to see him at the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then. 
 After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one of the staff whether his meeting would last much longer. 
 I asked what sort of legal proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk, and whether he was not making some mistake, but he said he was not making any mistake, there were legal proceedings underway and even that they were about something quite serious, but he did not know any more about it. 
 He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief clerk himself, as the chief clerk was a gentleman, good and honest, but he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be some influential gentlemen who would take his side. 
 I'm sure that is what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the end, but in the mean time things do not look at all good, and you can see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself. 
 It was very touching, and even the theatre tickets, which he would regularly send her from then on, would not be enough to repay her, but he really did not feel, now, that it was right for him to visit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little, eighteen year old schoolgirl. 
 "And what do you have to say about that?" asked his uncle,who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read the letter, and seemed to be about to read it again. 
 I don't like the way you're behaving," he said, looking at K. with his head at an angle, "that's not how an innocent man behaves when he's accused of something, not if he's still got any strength in him. 
 And I know very well that I have to account to the family for what I do." 
 K.'s uncle, still angry and excited, gestured with his hand to show that K. had summoned him, even though there was no need whatever to do so. K. stood in front of the desk and explained to the young man, who listened calm and attentive, what would need to be done that day in his absence, speaking in a calm voice and making use of various documents. 
 The presence of K.'s uncle while this was going on was quite disturbing; he did not listen to what was being said, but at first he stood there with eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips. 
 Once they were in the front hall of the bank, where several members of staff were standing about and where, just then, the deputy director was walking across, there was unfortunately no way of stopping K.'s uncle from continually asking questions about the trial. 
 K. made a few comments which conveyed little information, even laughed a little, and it was only when they reached the front steps that he explained to his uncle that he had not wanted to talk openly in front of those people. 
 They were standing on the front steps of the bank; as the doorkeeper seemed to be listening to what they were saying K. drew his uncle down further, where they were absorbed into the bustle of the street. 
 "Things like this don't come all of a sudden, they start developing a long time beforehand, there must have been warning signs of it, why didn't you write to me? 
 But besides that it'll be a way of getting you away from the court, to some extent. 
 Here they've got every means of showing the powers at their disposal and they're automatically bound to use them against you; in the country they'll either have to delegate authority to different bodies or just have to try and bother you by letter, telegram or telephone. 
 And that's bound to weaken the effect, it won't release you from them but it'll give you room to breathe." 
 And that everyone you know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated, disgraced right down to the ground. 
 "My dear Uncle," said K., "it won't do any good to get excited, it's no good for you to do it and it'd be no good for me to do it. 
 Only, I don't see any advantage in staying in the country, not even for you, as that would indicate flight and a sense of guilt. 
 And besides, although I am more subject to persecution if I stay in the city I can also press the matter forward better here." 
 "You're right," said his uncle in a tone that seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer to each other, "I just made the suggestion because, as I saw it, if you stay in the city the case will be put in danger by your indifference to it, and I thought it was better if I did the work for you. 
 "Well, naturally I'll have to think about it," said his uncle, "you must bear in mind that I've been living in the country for twenty years now, almost without a break, you lose your ability to deal with matters like this. 
 But I do have some important connections with several people who, I expect, know their way around these things better than I do, and to contact them is a matter of course. 
 Out there in the country I've been getting out of condition, I'm sure you're already aware of that. 
 And this affair of yours came largely unexpected, although, oddly enough, I had expected something of the sort after I'd read Erna's letter, and today when I saw your face I knew it with almost total certainty. 
 But all that is by the by, the important thing now is, we have no time to lose." 
 He's got a very good reputation as a defence barrister and for working with the poor. 
 K. instantly began telling his uncle about what had been happening, holding nothing back - being completely open with him was the only way that K. could protest at his uncle's belief that the trial was a great disgrace. 
 K.'s uncle knocked at the very first door at ground level; while they waited he smiled, showing his big teeth, and whispered, "Eight o'clock; not the usual sort of time to be visiting a lawyer, but Huld won't mind it from me." 
 He pulled his dressing gown together and disappeared. The door had indeed been opened, a young girl - K. recognised the dark, slightly bulging eyes - stood in the hallway in a long white apron, holding a candle in her hand. 
 K. continued to look at the girl in amazement as she turned round to block the way into the living room, she had a round face like a puppy's, not only the pale cheeks and the chin were round but the temples and the hairline were too. 
 "I think it is, sir," said the girl, who by now had found time to go ahead with the candle and open the door into the room. 
 In one corner of the room, where the light of the candle did not reach, a face with a long beard looked up from the bed. 
 K.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man who lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and down behind the carer, and K. would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed. 
 Dr. Huld's carer was still leant far over the invalid's bed and smoothing out the cloth covering the wall next to it, she merely turned her head and then, in striking contrast with the anger that first stopped K.'s uncle from speaking and then let the words out in a gush, she said very quietly, "You can see that Dr. Huld is so ill that he can't discuss any matters at all." 
 "You damned ... ," in the first gurglings of his excitement his words could hardly be understood, K. was startled even though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the intention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his hands. 
 "Oh!" said the invalid, now with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K. "Do forgive me, I didn't notice you there at all." 
 Then he then said to his carer, "Leni, go," stretching his hand out to her as if this were a farewell that would have to last for a long time. This time the girl offered no resistance. 
 The lawyer now looked so much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was ill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself of one elbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a lock of hair in the middle of his beard. 
 But that was impossible, everything that had happened so far spoke against it. So he said, 
 "Oh, I see," said the lawyer with a smile. "I am a lawyer, I move in court circles, people talk about various different cases and the more interesting ones stay in your mind, especially when they concern the nephew of a friend. 
 I'm at a bit of a disadvantage now, of course, because of my illness, but I still get visits from some good friends of mine at the court and I learn one or two things. 
 It might even be that I learn more than many of those who are in the best of health and spend all day in court. 
 It's only possible to appreciate just how valuable a visit like this is if you've been let into the secret of what a pile of work the office director has heaped over him. 
 There was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if something of porcelain were being broken. 
 When he had sat down, K. continued to look round the room, it was a large room with a high ceiling, the clients of this lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it. 
 Firstly, I had to listen to what the old men were saying and couldn't leave without a good reason, but secondly I'm not a bold person, if anything I'm quite shy, and you, Leni, you didn't really look like you could be won over in one stroke, either." 
 I'm accumulating women to help me, he thought to himself almost in amazement, first Miss Bürstner, then the court usher's wife, and now this little care assistant who seems to have some incomprehensible need for me. 
 She spread the middle and ring fingers of her right hand apart from each other. Between those fingers the flap of skin connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the little finger. 
 In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she wanted to show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel. 
 Just then, her knee slipped out and, with a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K. tried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her. 
 You don't even try to find an excuse, don't try to hide anything, no, you're quite open about it, you run off with her and stay there. 
 And meanwhile we're sitting there, your uncle who's going to such effort for you, the lawyer who needs to be won over to your side, and above all the office director, a very important gentleman who is in direct command of your affair in its present stage. 
 We wanted to discuss how best to help you, I had to handle the lawyer very carefully, he had to handle the office director carefully, and you had most reason of all to at least give me some support. 
 Eventually we couldn't keep up the pretence any longer, but these are polite and highly capable men, they didn't say anything about it so as to spare my feelings but in the end not even they could continue to force themselves and, as they couldn't speak about the matter in hand, they became silent. 
 In the end the office director stood up, as he had stayed far longer than he had originally intended, made his farewell, looked at me in sympathy without being able to help, he waited at the door for a long time although it's more than I can understand why he was being so good, and then he went. 
 He had told the servitor he was engaged in a major piece of work and none of the junior staff should be allowed in to see him, so he would not be disturbed by them at least. 
 But instead of working he turned round in his chair, slowly moved various items around his desk, but then, without being aware of it, he lay his arm stretched out on the desk top and sat there immobile with his head sunk down on his chest. 
 He was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his head. 
 He had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work out a written defence and hand it in to the court. 
 There was no doubt of the advantages a written defence of this sort would have over relying on the lawyer, who was anyway not without his shortcomings. 
 His speeches were as pointless as they were boring, and K. decided that when the final bill came he would pay not a penny for them. 
 He had already, he would then say, won many such cases, partly or in whole, cases which may not really have been as difficult as this one but which, on the face of it, had even less hope of success. 
 He had a list of these cases here in the drawer - here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk - but could, unfortunately, not show them to K. as they dealt with official secrets. 
 If the applicant becomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision, as soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard, of course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have been submitted will also be checked over. 
 If anything about the individual charges and the reasons for them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is being questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documents that really direct the issue and present proof, but not before. 
 So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a counsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before this court as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer. 
 The effect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole procedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like to have a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it. 
 The room they've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will be enough to show what contempt the court has for these people. 
 In the floor of this room - to give yet another example of the conditions there - there is a hole that's been there for more than a year, it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big enough for your foot to disappear through it. 
 The lawyers' room is on the second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang down into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the corridor where the litigants are waiting. 
 They want, as far as possible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the responsibility of the accused. 
 And the accused doesn't get to see the court records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in the court records from what's been said during questioning based on them, especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced with every possible worry to distract him. 
 Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present while the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possible still at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he can about it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, even though what the accused has to report is often very confused. 
 But that is not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can be learned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, a competent man will learn more than another. 
 Now K. will most likely have already learned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, the court organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictly closed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes do, to some extent, show where the gaps are. 
 This is where most lawyers will push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information extracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents where documents have been stolen. 
 That is the only way the progress of the trial can be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then on it becomes more and more visible. 
 There are, of course, not many lawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in this matter. 
 It is not at all necessary for Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the examining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve something which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent than real and most often not even that. 
 On the other hand, it's also true that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence - which will of course be done with great expertise - just for philanthropic reasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truer to say that they, too, have it allocated to them. 
 This is where the disadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start, stipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force. 
 The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to happen. 
 So civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go through, the final verdict or the reasons for it. 
 There is a story, for instance, that has very much the ring of truth about it. 
 It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. 
 On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside. 
 One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps. 
 Those who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or even to want to. 
 The only right thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is. 
 Then you no longer feel very sure of anything and, if asked about a trial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted in it, would not even dare deny that. 
 Lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort - and they are no more than fits of depression of course - when a case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they've been conducting it satisfactorily for some time. 
 It doesn't meant that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing so, it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't be told anything of what's happening. 
 As he had said, the time for submitting documents was still in the future and there was no rush to prepare them, it was much more important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate officials, and they had already taken place. 
 So all in all, the results are very encouraging, only you should certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed further that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings has been. 
 He went through it all again every time K. went to see him. 
 "I wanted to take the dishes away," said Leni, they would give each other's hands a final squeeze, the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then start talking at K. again with renewed energy. 
 Maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right, even though he obviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and probably had never even taken on a case as important as he said K.'s was. 
 Could it be that they were making use of the lawyer to turn trials in a certain direction, which would, of course, always be at the cost of the defendant? 
 If he had been alone in the world it would have been easy for him to ignore it, although it was also certain that, in that case, the trial would never have arisen in the first place. 
 The most important thing, if something was to be achieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way guilty. 
 The trial was nothing but a big piece of business, just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank many times, a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers waiting in ambush for him, as they usually did, and these dangers would need to be defended against. 
 If that was to be achieved then he must not entertain any idea of guilt, whatever he did, he would need to look after his own interests as closely as he could. 
 The lawyer had told him, as he talked to him, that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a great deal of harm, but K. could not tolerate any impediment to his efforts where his trial was concerned, and these impediments were probably caused by the lawyer himself. 
 But once he had shaken off the lawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and, if possible, he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with every day. 
 It would of course not be enough, if that was to be done, for K. to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the others. 
 Day after day, he himself, or one of the women or somebody else on his behalf, would have to run after the officials and force them to sit at their desks and study K.'s documents instead of looking out on the corridor through the grating. 
 There could be no let-up in these efforts, everything would need to be organised and supervised, it was about time that the court came up against a defendant who knew how to defend and make use of his rights. 
 But when K. had the confidence to try and do all this the difficulty of composing the documents was too much for him. 
 Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to it, his finger felt for the button of the electric bell in the ante-room. 
 As he pressed it he glanced up to the clock. It was eleven o'clock, two hours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just dreaming and his wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had been before. 
 As well as various pieces of mail, the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had already been waiting for K. for some time. 
 Why had they come at such an awkward time, and why, the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed to be asking, was the industrious K. using up the best business time for his private affairs? 
 Tired from what had gone before, and tired in anticipation of what was to follow, K. stood up to receive the first of them. 
 The manufacturer thought there must be some objection, perhaps his figures weren't really sound, perhaps they weren't the decisive issue, whatever he thought, the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and began once again, moving very close to K., to explain what the deal was all about. 
 "It is difficult," said K., pursing his lips. 
 The only thing that could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturer had covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm of the chair. 
 Even when the door of the manager's office opened and revealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, he did no more than look up weakly. 
 K. thought no more about the matter, he merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director's appearance and, for him, the effect was very pleasing; the manufacturer immediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy director, although K. would have liked to make him ten times livelier as he feared the deputy director might disappear again. 
 Carefully and slowly turning his eyes upwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one of the papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it on the flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level of the two men himself. 
 And I'm sure the chief clerk ..." - even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the manufacturer - "will be very glad to have us take it off his hands. 
 He remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what it actually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance, slightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer room where, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise. 
 No-one came, and that made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his face with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his place by the window. 
 If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then his experience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would be quite enough to convince him of it. 
 Did a carefully worked out defence - and any other sort would have made no sense - did a carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself off from everything else as much as he could? 
 It involved much more than just submitting some documents that he could probably prepare in a few days' leave, although it would have been great temerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time, it was a whole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last. 
 Was he supposed to let people in to see him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this? While his trial trundled on, while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat looking at the papers for this trial, should he be worrying about the business of the bank? 
 But he hoped rumours had not reached as far as the deputy director, otherwise he would obviously soon find a way of making use of it to harm K., he would show neither comradeship nor humaneness. 
 "It's a horrible autumn," said the manufacturer, who had come into the room unnoticed after seeing the deputy director and now stood behind K. 
 I'm very sorry if it's something that'll be a burden to you today of all days but I've been to see you twice already, lately, and each time I forgot all about it. 
 He's been coming to me in my office for years from time to time, and brings little pictures with him which I buy more or less just for the sake of charity as he's hardly more than a beggar. 
 Ever since then I learn something new about the court every time he comes to visit, and so little by little I get to understand something of how it works. 
 Anyway, Titorelli talks a lot and I often have to push him away, not only because he's bound to be lying but also, most of all, because a businessman like me who's already close to breaking point under the weight of his own business worries can't pay too much attention to other people's. 
 Perhaps - this is what I've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able to help you in some small way, he knows lots of judges and even if he can't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get some influential people on your side. 
 It needn't be today, of course, just some time, when you get the chance. 
 And anyway - I want to tell you this too - you don't actually have to go and see Titorelli, this advice from me doesn't place you under any obligation at all. 
 No, if that's the case then of course you shouldn't go there under any circumstances! 
 "I'll go there," he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door, "or, as I'm very busy at present, I'll write to him, perhaps he would like to come to me in my office some time." 
 And it's not always a good idea to send letters to people like Titorelli, you don't know what might happen to them. 
 And just now, just when he would have to act with all the strength he could muster, now a number of doubts of a sort he had never before known had presented themselves and affected his own vigilance! 
 The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out his office work; were they now going to affect the trial too? 
 He shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor came up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who were waiting on a bench in the ante-room. 
 The gentlemen now saw that their wait had been totally pointless, and these suggestions of K.'s left them so astounded that they looked at each other without a word. 
 So K. turned the collar of his coat up and buttoned it up high under his chin. Just then the deputy director came out of the adjoining room, smiled as he saw K. negotiating with the gentlemen in his winter coat, and asked, "Are you about to go out?" 
 The deputy director listened to them for a short while, he also looked at K. as he held his hat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there, and then he said, "Gentlemen, there is a very simple way to solve this. 
 It would probably be much better to take off his winter coat again and, at the very least, try to win back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next room. 
 "I'm looking for a copy of a contract," he said, "which this gentleman insists you must have. Could you help me look for it, do you think?" 
 K. made a step forward, but the deputy director said, "thank you, I've already found it," and with a big package of papers, which certainly must have included many more documents than just the copy of the contract, he turned and went back into his own office. 
 K. did no more that glance at any of these things, he wanted to get things over with here as soon as possible, to exchange just a few words to find out how things stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank. 
 On the third floor he had to slow down his pace, he was quite out of breath - the steps, just like the height of each floor, were much higher than they needed to be and he'd been told that the painter lived right up in the attic. 
 K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who had stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they went up side by side, "Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?" 
 Up at the head of the line of girls, who now, laughing, began to close in around K., was the hunchback who had taken on the role of leader. 
 It was thanks to her that K. found the right direction without delay - he would have continued up the stairs straight in front of him, but she showed him that to reach Titorelli he would need to need to turn off to one side. 
 The steps that led up to the painter were especially narrow, very long without any turning, the whole length could be seen in one glance and, at the top, at Titorelli's closed door, it came to its end. 
 This door was much better illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the light from a small skylight set obliquely above it, it had been put together from unpainted planks of wood and the name 'Titorelli' was painted on it in broad, red brushstrokes. 
 K. was no more than half way up the steps, accompanied by his retinue of girls, when, clearly the result of the noise of all those footsteps, the door opened slightly and in the crack a man who seemed to be dressed in just his nightshirt appeared. 
 They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter up above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow, invited K. to enter. 
 The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keep away, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged him and however much they tried to get in - if they could not get in with his permission they would try to force their way in against his will. 
 One behind the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but which K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the hunchback whirled round in his hand. 
 If I'm here they only come in when I allow it, but as soon as I've gone out there's always at least one of them in here. 
 They had a key made to my door and lend it round to each other. 
 Meanwhile, K. had been looking round the room, if it had not been pointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched little room could be called a studio. 
 This impression was augmented by the painter's asking, "Were you wanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?" 
 But everything else about the picture was similar, as this judge, too, was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed ominously about to rise from it. 
 At first K. was about to say, "He certainly is a judge," but he held himself back for the time being and went closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail. 
 That'll need some more work done on it, the painter told him, and taking a pastel crayon from a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the figure but without making it any clearer as far as K. could make out. 
 "Yes," said the painter, "I had to paint it like that according to the contract. It's actually the figure of justice and the goddess of victory all in one." 
 "That is not a good combination," said K. with a smile. "Justice needs to remain still, otherwise the scales will move about and it won't be possible to make a just verdict." 
 It's laid down quite strictly just what sort of portrait each of them can get for himself. 
 K. found the painter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he reproached himself for staying so long without having done anything relevant to his own affair. 
 K. took this to be just a foible of the painter's, and it irritated him as it made him lose time. 
 K. forewent the opportunity to excuse himself in some way as he did not wish to distract the painter from what he was saying, or else perhaps he didn't want him to get too far above himself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable, so he asked, "Is that a publicly acknowledged position?" 
 But K. wanted him to continue speaking and said, "Well, positions like that, that aren't officially acknowledged, can often have more influence than those that are." 
 "And that's how it is with me," said the painter, and nodded with a frown. "I was talking about your case with the manufacturer yesterday, and he asked me if I wouldn't like to help you, and I answered: 'He can come and see me if he likes', and now I'm pleased to see you here so soon. 
 The air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive for him, he had several times looked in amazement at a small, iron stove in the corner that certainly could not have been lit, the heat of the room was inexplicable. 
 K. made no reply, but it was actually not the heat that made him uncomfortable but, much more, the stuffiness, the air that almost made it more difficult to breathe, the room had probably not been ventilated for a long time. 
 The unpleasantness of this was made all the stronger for K. when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while he himself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel. 
 He felt a simple joy at answering this question, especially as the answer was given to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences. 
 "Yeah, yeah, sure," said the painter, as if K. had been disturbing his train of thought for no reason. "But you are innocent, aren't you?" 
 There was no counter-argument that could influence him, but although he had made up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this way because of conviction or indifference. 
 But they were all agreed on one thing, and that was that when ill thought-out accusations are made they are not ignored, and that once the court has made an accusation it is convinced of the guilt of the defendant and it's very hard to make it think otherwise." 
 If I painted all the judges next to each other here on canvas, and you were trying to defend yourself in front of it, you'd have more success with them than you'd ever have with the real court." 
 There followed an incomprehensible, interwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement. 
 K. had hardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to the painter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he wanted to. 
 "You still don't seem to have much general idea of what the court's about", said the painter, who had stretched his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor with the tip of his foot. "But as you're innocent you won't need it anyway. 
 "How do you intend to do that?" asked K. "You did say yourself not long ago that it's quite impossible to go to the court with reasons and proofs." 
 It sometimes seemed to him as if the painter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome to the trial a precondition for his help, which of course would make the help itself unnecessary. 
 K. valued the painter's help far more highly because it was offered in a way that was more harmless and open. 
 Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused is innocent. 
 I've never seen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand that the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't say that the judges can be influenced. 
 I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know of many times when a judge has been influenced. 
 The courts don't make their final conclusions public, not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all we know about these earlier cases are just legends. 
 "Then there's no point in talking about them," said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept anything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or contradicted what he had been told by others. 
 He had prepared himself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his open mouth. 
 There's not much need to air the room as there's so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when I do want to I can open one of my doors, or even both of them." 
 You can get either of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, the difference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated effort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has to be sustained. 
 Then when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take it to the judge who's concerned with your case. 
 When he has the document asserting the defendant's innocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquit you without any worries, and although there are still several formalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'll do as a favour to me and several other acquaintances. 
 Even while the painter was speaking those last words K. had laid his coat over his arm and had stood up. Immediately, from outside the door, there was a cry of 'He's standing up now!'. 
 "Oh yes," said K., whose head was aching from the effort of listening. 
 Despite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more, as if he wanted to give K. something to console him on his way home. 
 Not even the girls could induce him to put his coat on, even though they were already loudly telling each other that he was doing so. 
 There's no more than a hair's breadth of difference between the advantages and disadvantages. 
 "I'll come back here again soon," said K., who had suddenly decided to put his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurried over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream. 
 "Will you open this door for me," said K. pulling at the handle which, as he noticed from the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls on the other side. 
 From under the bed, the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust swirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some time. 
 K. expressed himself in this curt way without any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this amiss and picked up a second painting from the floor. 
 But K. was not in the mood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter cum beggar. 
 It seemed to him that one of the most basic rules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared, never allow surprises, never to look, unsuspecting, to the right when the judge stood beside him to his left - and this was the very basic rule that he was continually violating. 
 There was a man there, half sitting, half laying, his face was buried in his arm on the bench and he seemed to be sleeping; another man was standing in the half-dark at the end of the corridor. 
 He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see he still had them. 
 When the door in front of him finally opened, he stormed straight into the hallway. Through the corridor which led between the rooms he saw Leni, to whom the warning cry of the door opener had been directed, still running away in her nightshirt . 
 "Oh, do forgive me!" said the man, and he looked at himself in the light of the candle he was holding as if he had not known about his appearance until then. 
 K. indicated with his hat which way the man was to go and let him go ahead of him. 
 In front of the picture of the judge K. took hold of the businessman's braces to stop him moving on. 
 "Well of course you have," called out K., "I'd forgotten about it, of course you would already have been told." 
 The stove alone was three times bigger than normal stoves, but it was not possible to see any detail beyond this as the kitchen was at the time illuminated by no more than a small lamp hanging by the entrance. 
 "Josef," said Leni, looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes, "you're not going to be jealous of Mr. Block now, are you? Rudi," she then said, turning to the businessman, "help me out will you, I'm being suspected of something, you can see that, leave the candle alone." 
 She helped him off with his coat, took the hat off his head, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up, then she ran back and saw to the soup. 
 He was in a bad mood, he had originally intended a detailed discussion of his business with Leni, especially the question of his giving the lawyer notice, but now he no longer wanted to because of the presence of the businessman. 
 Now he considered his affair too important to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some of his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already on her way to the lawyer. 
 "You're a client of the lawyer's too, aren't you," said the businessman quietly from his corner as if he were trying to find this out. 
 When she went over to him with the dish she deliberately brushed against him and whispered, "I'll tell him you're here as soon as he's eaten the soup so that I can get you back as soon as possible." 
 Probably, my trial's been going on much longer than that, it started soon after the death of my wife, and that's been more than five and a half years now." 
 "It is, here," said the businessman, who had had some difficulty breathing since making his confession but who now, after hearing K.'s comment, began to feel more trust for him. 
 I've taken all the money out of my business, for example, the offices for my business used to occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all I need is a little room at the back where I work with one apprentice. 
 It wasn't just using up the money that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to do with me not working at the business as much as I used to. 
 "I expect I'll have to go there quite often myself now," said K., "although I can hardly expect to be shown the same respect as I was then. 
 There are lots who believe that, and they said they could see from the shape of your lips that you'd definitely be found guilty very soon. 
 There are lots of things there that can make you confused, of course, but one of them, for him, was the appearance of your lips. 
 So there's nothing to be achieved by forming into a group, only sometimes an individual will achieve something in secret; and it's only when that's been done the others learn about it; nobody knows how it was done. 
 "I saw those gentlemen in the waiting room," said K., "it seemed so pointless for them to be waiting in that way." 
 You might think - I thought it myself at first - you might think I could leave the whole thing entirely up to them now. 
 I even read one of them myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful. 
 Although, as far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had been carried out very carefully. 
 "That's a very sensible question," said the businessman with a smile, "it's only very rare that you see any progress in these proceedings at all. 
 I'm a businessman, much more in those days than now, I wanted to see some tangible progress, it should have all been moving to some conclusion or at least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules. 
 When he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them apart by calling them the 'great lawyers'. 
 They do defend a lot of people, but you can't get hold of them by your own efforts, they only defend those who they want to defend. 
 But that, of course, would be the stupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed for very long either." 
 "Not for very long," said the businessman, and smiled again, "you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid, especially in the night when these thoughts come so easily. 
 They were indeed sat close together, if either of them turned his head even slightly it would have knocked against the other's, the businessman was not only very small but also sat hunched down, so that K. was also forced to bend down low if he wanted to hear everything. 
 She spoke to the businessman with affection but, at the same time, with condescension. K. did not like that, he had begun to learn that the man was of some value after all, he had experience at least, and he was willing to share it. 
 "Yes, that's right," said the businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying. 
 "You'll still be here?" he asked the businessman, wanting to hear the answer from him and not wanting Leni to speak about the businessman as if he weren't there, he was full of secret resentment towards Leni today. 
 Well, your friends, or at least I do, we like to do things for you. 
 "He likes to sleep here really, he's often said so." She went over to a little door and shoved it open. 
 K. went over to the low, windowless room and looked in from the doorway. The room contained a narrow bed which filled it completely, so that to get into the bed you would need to climb over the bedpost. 
 At the head of the bed there was a niche in the wall where, fastidiously tidy, stood a candle, a bottle of ink, and a pen with a bundle of papers which were probably to do with the trial. 
 For himself, he wanted to go to the lawyer and, by dismissing him, free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman. But before he had reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently. 
 Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain this peculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the way you're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity of hers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused attractive. 
 She attaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even seems to be loved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me about them when I allow her to. 
 But there are nonetheless those who have experience in these matters who can look at a crowd, however big, and tell you which among them is facing a charge. 
 It is simply that those who are facing a charge are the most attractive. 
 "Yes," said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his eyes from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer better, "I wanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation from you, with immediate effect." 
 He used the word 'we', as if he had no intention of letting K. go free, and as if, even if he could no longer represent him, he could still at least continue as his adviser. 
 "The circumstances are important enough," said the lawyer as he wrapped the bed cover around the top half of his body and then the blanket around his legs. "Your uncle is my friend and in the course of time I've become fond of you as well. 
 When I was by myself I never did anything about my case, I was hardly aware of it, but then, once there was someone representing me, everything was set for something to happen, I was always, without cease, waiting for you to do something, getting more and more tense, but you did nothing. 
 So many litigants, at the same stage in their trials, have stood before me just like you are now and spoken in the same way." 
 He was showing no regard for the dignity of his position, which on this point, must have been at its most sensitive. 
 It was not possible to learn anything by looking at him, even though K. was scrutinizing him quite brazenly. 
 It could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have. 
 This is partly to do with changes in the way I do business, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more on matters such as your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper understanding that I acquire from these legal matters. 
 He had to put a stop to that, so he said, "What will you undertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?" 
 Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so. She looked hurriedly at K. and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened; she seemed to be reassured by the sight of K. sitting calmly at the lawyer's bed. 
 Block noticed that at least no-one was chasing him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was tense, his hands were clenched behind his back. 
 Block had already crept some way into the room but this question seemed to give him first a shove in the breast and then another in the back, he seemed about to fall but remained standing, deeply bowed, and said, "At your service, sir." 
 "Wasn't I summoned?" asked Block, more to himself than the lawyer. He held his hands in front of himself as protection and would have been ready to run away any moment. 
 "You were summoned," said the lawyer, "but you have still come at a bad time." Then, after a pause he added, "You always come at a bad time." 
 "I went to see," said the lawyer, "the third judge yesterday, a friend of mine, and slowly brought the conversation round to the subject of you. 
 "No-one besides you, sir," said Block. 
 "And let there be no-one besides me," said the lawyer. Block fully understood what that meant, he glowered at K., shaking his head violently. 
 You can count the length of his trial in hours, and he wants to tell me what to do when I've been involved in a legal case for five years. 
 He doesn't know anything, but he insults me, when I, as far as my weak ability allows, when I've made a close study of how to behave with the court, what we ought to do and what the court practices are." 
 "I will," said Block, as if speaking to himself to give himself courage, and with a quick glance to the side he kneeled down close beside the bed. 
 It was clear that he desperately needed to be told something by the lawyer, although perhaps only so that he could make use of the information with his other lawyers. 
 Then Leni leant over the lawyer, as she stretched out, the attractive shape of her body could be seen, and, bent over close to his face, she stroked his long white hair. 
 That now forced him to give an answer. "I'm rather wary of telling him," said the lawyer, and his head could be seen shaking slightly, perhaps so that he would feel the pressure of Leni's hand better. 
 Finally she gave a serious nod, turned back to the lawyer and said, "He's been quiet and industrious." 
 Even if there was some plan behind what he did, there was nothing that could reinstate him in the eyes of his fellow man. 
 Even if he had done nothing earlier to make him want to leave then this scene would have done so. 
 So these were the lawyer's methods, which K. fortunately had not been exposed to for long, to let the client forget about the whole world and leave him with nothing but the hope of reaching the end of his trial by this deluded means. 
 If the lawyer had ordered him to crawl under the bed as if it were a kennel and to bark out from under it, then he would have done so with enthusiasm. 
 That's where he usually stays. From time to time I looked in through the spyhole to see was he was doing, and each time he was kneeling on the bed and reading the papers you gave him, propped up on the window sill. 
 But they should at least give him some inkling of just how hard a struggle it is and how much work it is for me to defend him. 
 This made his astonishment all the more obvious when he heard the following words from the lawyer: "You speak well of him," said the lawyer, "but that's just what makes it difficult for me. 
 'You're letting him abuse you,' he repeated. 'I don't think so,' said I. 
 You don't always find such enthusiasm as that. He's not very pleasant personally, I grant you, his manners are terrible and he's dirty, but as far as the trial's concerned he's quite immaculate.' 
 He's accumulated plenty of experience and knows how to delay proceedings. But there's more that he doesn't know than he does. 
 You should be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client! 
 You know that there are so many various opinions about the procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can make any sense of them. 
 At a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it that a sign is given by ringing a bell. 
 I can't set out all the opinions opposed to that view here, and you wouldn't understand it anyway, suffice it to say that there are many reasons to disagree with him." 
 "Block," said Leni, as if reprimanding him, and, taking hold of the collar of his coat, pulled him up slightly higher. "Leave the carpet alone and listen to what the lawyer is saying." 
 A very important Italian business contact of the bank had come to visit the city for the first time and K. was given the task of showing him some of its cultural sights. 
 It would not have been difficult for him to turn down most of these jobs, but he did not dare to do so because, if his fears had the slightest foundation, turning the jobs down would have been an acknowledgement of them. 
 It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temper at the thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock in the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would prevent him. 
 K. did not quite understand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took K. a little while to guess its meaning. 
 He replied with a few bland phrases which the Italian received once more with a laugh, passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy moustache. This moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come close to it and sniff. 
 When they had all sat down and begun a light preliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that he understood no more than fragments of what the Italian said. 
 Whatever the cause, K. realised that the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely taken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered some help in understanding what he said. 
 He spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the cathedral. 
 At exactly half past nine, just when he was about to leave, there was a telephone call for him, Leni wished him good morning and asked how he was, K. thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for him to talk now as he had to go to the cathedral. 
 The square in front of the cathedral was quite empty, K. remembered how even as a small child he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square had the curtains at their windows closed most of the time, although today, with the weather like this, it was more understandable. 
 K. hurried along both the side naves but saw no-one but an old woman who, wrapped up in a warm shawl, was kneeling at a picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it. 
 To pass the time he opened the album and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything in the side nave next to him. 
 It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate to illuminate the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the side altars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper. 
 It was discourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him, there would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content themselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pocket torch and looking at them one small part at a time. 
 K. went over to a nearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up a few steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar picture by the light of his torch. 
 He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was being played out in front of him. 
 It was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and he studied the knight for a long time even though he had continually to blink as he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch. 
 There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer, but outside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so cold in the cathedral as K. had expected he decided to stay there for the time being. 
 The outside of the pulpit's balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to the column supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves, some of them lively and some of them still. 
 Then K. happened to notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews, he wore a loose, creased, black cassock, he held a snuff box in his left hand and he was watching K. Now what does he want? thought K. Do I seem suspicious to him? 
 "This old man is like a child," thought K., "he doesn't have the sense for anything more than serving in a church. 
 With a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up the side nave and almost as far as the main altar, all this time the old man continued to point at something but K. deliberately avoided looking round, he was only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to follow him. 
 It was very simple, made of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked like an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been. 
 In all, it looked as if it had been intended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available which were large and so artistically decorated. 
 And there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary, an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon. 
 The priest - there was no doubt that he was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face - was clearly going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by mistake. 
 But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check that the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly turned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular rail with both hands. 
 Somewhere in the church - he could not have said exactly where - he could make out the man in the cassock hunched under his bent back and at peace, as if his work were completed. 
 When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did not hesitate but simply reached out for the album he had left there and took it with him. 
 But if he once turned round he would be trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood perfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called to and that he was willing to follow. 
 If the priest had called out again K. would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything was silent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted to see what the priest was doing now. 
 And K. did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a long way back just to see the priest. 
 "That's how it seems to me too," said K. "I've expended a lot of effort on it, but so far with no result. 
 "You look for too much help from people you don't know," said the priest disapprovingly, "and especially from women. 
 Show the examining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the desk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can." 
 The priest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof over the pulpit seem to press him down. 
 And this was the moment when the man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one by one. 
 "Well, it's just my own experience," said K. Above him there was still silence. "I didn't mean to insult you," said K. 
 If the priest knew of such a possibility he might, if K. asked him, let him know about it, even though he was part of the court himself and even though, when K. had criticised the court, he had held down his gentle nature and actually shouted at K. 
 "Would you not like to come down here?" asked K. "If you're not going to give a sermon come down here with me." 
 "Now I can come down," said the priest, perhaps he regretted having shouted at K. As he took down the lamp from its hook he said, "to start off with I had to speak to you from a distance. 
 While he was still on one of the higher steps as he came down them the priest reached out his hand for K. to shake. 
 Even at close distance the priest did not lose a certain solemnity that seemed to be part of his character. 
 "That makes you an exception among all those who belong to the court. I can trust you more than any of the others I've seen. 
 But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of them is more powerful than the last. 
 The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he's from and many other things, but these are disinterested questions such as great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can't let him in. 
 He becomes senile, and as he has come to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he has been studying him he even asks them to help him and change the doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no longer knows whether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving him. 
 Just before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all this time into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper. 
 He beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body. 
 It might have been his duty to keep everyone else away, but this man is who the door was intended for and he ought to have let him in." 
 "You're not paying enough attention to what was written and you're changing the story," said the priest. "According to the story, there are two important things that the doorkeeper explains about access to the law, one at the beginning, one at the end. 
 But in the doorkeeper's character there are also other features which might be very useful for those who seek entry to the law, and when he hinted at some possibility in the future it always seemed to make it clear that he might even go beyond his duty. 
 However you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out differently from how you might think." 
 "You know the story better than I do and you've known it for longer," said K. They were silent for a while. And then K. said, "So you think the man was not cheated, do you?" 
 "That does seem to take things too far," said K. "How can they argue the doorkeeper has been cheated?" 
 Above all, the free man is superior to the man who has to serve another. 
 Now, the man really is free, he can go wherever he wants, the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and, what's more, there's only one man forbidding him to do so - the doorkeeper. 
 If he takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his life he does this of his own free will, there's nothing in the story to say he was forced to do it. 
 On the other hand, the doorkeeper is kept to his post by his employment, he's not allowed to go away from it and it seems he's not allowed to go inside either, not even if he wanted to. 
 And it's pointed out repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of this, although this is not seen as anything remarkable, as those who hold this view see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that's far worse, a way that's to do with his service. 
 Although that does not mean I've abandoned what I thought earlier as the two versions are, to some extent, not incompatible. 
 However he might seem to us he is still in the service of the law, so he belongs to the law, so he's beyond what man has a right to judge. 
 The man has come to the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is already there. 
 "I can't say I'm in complete agreement with this view," said K. shaking his head, "as if you accept it you'll have to accept that everything said by the doorkeeper is true. 
 K. said that as if it were his final word but it was not his conclusion. 
 He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of the story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar to him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of the court to discuss than for him. 
 Once, just in front of him, he thought he could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it, although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness. 
 I'm the chief clerk in a bank and there are people waiting for me, I only came here to show a foreign business contact round the cathedral." 
 In frock coats, pale and fat, wearing top hats that looked like they could not be taken off their heads. 
 Most of the windows on the other side of the street were also dark already, many of them had the curtains closed. 
 In one of the windows on the same floor where there was a light on, two small children could be seen playing with each other inside a playpen, unable to move from where they were, reaching out for each other with their little hands. 
 "Theatre?" asked one of the gentlemen, turning to the other for assistance and pulling in the corners of his mouth. 
 The other made a gesture like someone who was dumb, as if he were struggling with some organism causing him trouble. 
 They formed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by matter that is lifeless. 
 Whenever they passed under a lamp K. tried to see his companions more clearly, as far as was possible when they were pressed so close together, as in the dim light of his room this had been hardly possible. 
 When K. noticed that, he stopped, which meant the others had to stop too; they were at the edge of an open square, devoid of people but decorated with flower beds. 
 "I will go no further," said K. as if to see what would happen. 
 The gentlemen did not need to make any answer, it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K. and tried to move him on, but K. resisted them. 
 He thought of the flies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper. "These gentleman will have some hard work to do". 
 Just then, Miss Bürstner came up into the square in front of them from the steps leading from a small street at a lower level. 
 He started walking, which pleased the gentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him. 
 I always wanted to go at the world and try and do too much, and even to do it for something that was not too cheap. 
 Should I let anyone say, after I'm gone, that at the start of the proceedings I wanted to end them, and that now that they've ended I want to start them again? 
 All three of them now, in complete agreement, went over a bridge in the light of the moon, the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little movement made by K. as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed the group in that direction as a single unit. 
 One of them with a bushy moustache, his hand on the grip of his sword, seemed to have some purpose in approaching the group, which was hardly unsuspicious. 
 Several times he looked back cautiously to see if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner between themselves and the policeman K. began to run, and the two gentlemen, despite being seriously short of breath, had to run with him. 
 In this way they quickly left the built up area and found themselves in the fields which, in this part of town, began almost without any transition zone. 
 Here the men stopped, perhaps because this had always been their destination or perhaps because they were too exhausted to run any further. 
 He did not want to expose K. to the chilly night air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and walked up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked round the quarry for a suitable place. 
 So one of the gentlemen asked the other to grant him a short time while he put K. in position by himself, but even that did nothing to make it better. 
 The repulsive courtesies began once again, one of them passed the knife over K. to the other, who then passed it back over K. to the first. 
 He was not able to show his full worth, was not able to take all the work from the official bodies, he lacked the rest of the strength he needed and this final shortcoming was the fault of whoever had denied it to him. 
 He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. 
 He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. 
 Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. 
 If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. 
 And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. 
 First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five." And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. 
 He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. 
 And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. 
 His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. 
 His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: "Gregor, open the door, I beg of you." 
 The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. 
 He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen. 
 It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. 
 If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. 
 "This is something that can't be done in bed", Gregor said to himself, "so don't keep trying to do it". 
 This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. 
 But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. 
 At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. 
 And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time. 
 After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. 
 "That'll be someone from work", he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around. 
 Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. 
 "I'll be there in a moment", said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation. 
 But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations." 
 In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry. 
 Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before? 
 It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. 
 You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention this just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. 
 This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. 
 And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed - where he now tried to get himself upright. 
 He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. 
 The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. 
 "That was the voice of an animal", said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's screams. 
 And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? 
 They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. 
 He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements - although he did not really distinguish one from the other. 
 He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. 
 The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: "So, I didn't need the locksmith after all". Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely. 
 He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. 
 So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. 
 The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers. 
 On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. 
 The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below. 
 You can see", he said to the chief clerk, "that I'm not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn't earn my living. 
 It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. 
 Please, don't go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!" 
 And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. 
 Gregor's appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder. 
 A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor. 
 Nothing would stop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. 
 It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. 
 When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. 
 He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. 
 It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep. 
 He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there. 
 It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. 
 Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. 
 Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. 
 The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides. 
 It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. 
 As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's use, and placed it beside them. 
 Then, out of consideration for Gregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked. 
 "Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?", he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper. 
 Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn't stand the smell. 
 Gregor's father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough. 
 It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything - there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. 
 "He's enjoyed his dinner today", she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, "now everything's just been left there again". 
 Although Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it. 
 Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted. 
 What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. 
 Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible. 
 They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. 
 Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. 
 If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. 
 His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. 
 It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. 
 First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter. 
 He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it. 
 The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. 
 He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. 
 He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back. 
 The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. 
 That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. 
 He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. 
 Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him. 
 Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements. 
 An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off without doing any harm. 
 Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion. 
 Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother "you're doing so much sewing again today!", as if he did not know that he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin. 
 Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. 
 The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. 
 Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. 
 But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address. 
 At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up Gregor's room was for her and her alone. 
 Gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected. 
 Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor's room and found herself face to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. 
 Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. 
 Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. 
 They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. 
 These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. 
 One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. 
 It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled. 
 It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. 
 The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. 
 "On the contrary", said the middle gentleman, "would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?" 
 It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed. 
 It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for. 
 On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar. 
 His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. 
 He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body. 
 For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action." 
 Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. 
 He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. 
 His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes. 
 We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can't endure it. I can't endure it any more." 
 If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will. 
 We wouldn't have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. 
 As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. 
 All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. 
 He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. 
 He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up. 
 When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying. 
 On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. 
 Gregor's body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away. 
 Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. 
 The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. 
 "Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's room. 
 Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader. 
 They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it. 
 The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. 
 The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. 
 "Yes", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, "well then, that thing in there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it. 
 Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to. 
 So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out "Cheerio then, everyone", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went. 
 The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters. 
 After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. 
 The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. 
 All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. 
 CHAPTER I — HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED 
 I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to principalities. 
 This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition. 
 For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives. 
 The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France. 
 He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality. 
 Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them. 
 Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. 
 He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty. 
 The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. 
 Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge. 
 So that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there. 
 He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country. 
 And he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles. 
 Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. 
 But he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna. 
 It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. 
 And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy. 
 Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she ought not to have divided it. 
 Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them. 
 CHAPTER IV — WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH 
 But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril. 
 The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. 
 This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned. 
 Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity. 
 The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them. 
 But in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there. 
 Let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. 
 I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state. 
 But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. 
 And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them. 
 It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage. 
 It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. 
 It was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace. 
 And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. 
 It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? 
 Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. 
 Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and happy. 
 To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan. 
 CHAPTER VII — CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE 
 Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. 
 Alexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had many immediate and prospective difficulties. 
 After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. 
 This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. 
 From this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the French. 
 Thereupon he promoted Messer Ramiro d'Orco, a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest power. 
 And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister. 
 But as to the future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope. 
 Secondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to himself. 
 But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. 
 If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. 
 But if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander, everything would have been different to him. 
 Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula. 
 Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics. 
 Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. 
 Being established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily. 
 What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius. 
 After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. 
 He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours. 
 Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects. 
 But coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to it, but rather a happy shrewdness. 
 A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. 
 The people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority. 
 He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking. 
 It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself, as they are few in number. 
 Further, the prince is compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away authority when it pleases him. 
 Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do not. 
 Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him. 
 But one who, in opposition to the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection. 
 Nabis, Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece, and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. 
 These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule personally or through magistrates. 
 Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful. 
 CHAPTER X — CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED 
 It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others. 
 In the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country. 
 And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them. 
 But being upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them. 
 And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances. 
 Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person. 
 CHAPTER XII — HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES 
 We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin. 
 The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms. 
 Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand; and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related. 
 And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty. 
 The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way. 
 And experience has shown princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. 
 Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio, allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. 
 But let us come to that which happened a short while ago. 
 From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners. 
 From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. 
 After these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers. 
 They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. 
 They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. 
 These arms may be useful and good in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive. 
 This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. 
 I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I have named above. 
 In conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast. 
 Charles the Seventh, the father of King Louis the Eleventh, having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry. 
 The armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one's own forces. 
 But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of hectic fevers. 
 And if the first disaster to the Roman Empire should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others. 
 I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. 
 And one's own forces are those which are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. 
 And the way to make ready one's own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself. 
 CHAPTER XIV — THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR 
 And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. 
 Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. 
 Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. 
 He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study. 
 And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage. 
 CHAPTER XV — CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED 
 This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly. 
 And if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends that which is his own or his subjects' or else that of others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. 
 And of that which is neither yours nor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you. 
 CHAPTER XVII — CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED 
 And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying: 
 Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable. 
 It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. 
 Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. 
 But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its duties. 
 This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect. 
 And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them. 
 The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. 
 Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. 
 This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. 
 Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. 
 If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. 
 Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. 
 And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity, friendship, humanity, and religion. 
 For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on. 
 One prince of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time. 
 It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain. 
 For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. 
 For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape. 
 And well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have. 
 Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. 
 From this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands. 
 It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them. 
 Wishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times. 
 It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus. 
 And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate. 
 After this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. 
 To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true. 
 But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies. 
 Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria. 
 He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion. 
 He was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne. 
 From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends. 
 Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm. 
 But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you. 
 3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. 
 The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. 
 Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state. 
 For this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher. 
 6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack. 
 And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. 
 The castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. 
 For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you. 
 Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. 
 He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them. 
 Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare. 
 Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them. 
 And a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man. 
 In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you. 
 Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate. 
 And here it is to be noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one. 
 But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of the parties. 
 Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil. 
 A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art. 
 Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. 
 Hence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions. 
 In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him. 
 Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom. 
 This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you. 
 This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour. 
 And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it would not have come at all. 
 And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in general. 
 But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. 
 Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success. 
 I conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. 
 Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustrious house, with its valour and fortune, favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could be made the head of this redemption. 
 Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those men to whom I have directed your attention. 
 Hence it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri. 
 If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers. 
 And although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied upon to overthrow them. 
 For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat. 
 Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry. 
 It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. 
 And these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new prince. 
 Let, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch: 
 Virtu contro al Furore Prendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto: Che l'antico valore Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto. Virtue against fury shall advance the fight, And it i' th' combat soon shall put to flight: For the old Roman valour is not dead, Nor in th' Italians' brests extinguished. 
 I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. 
 I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment—that of looking down within the tarn—had been to deepen the first singular impression. 
 No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. 
 Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn. 
 Upon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality—of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world. 
 It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. 
 And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. 
 I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. 
 I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. 
 It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of the performances. 
 I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. 
 Our books—the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid—were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. 
 His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan—but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes—an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor. 
 But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion. 
 It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. 
 From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. 
 His head had dropped upon his breast—yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. 
 The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea—for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. 
 No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver—I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled, reverberation. 
 Long—long—long—many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it—yet I dared not—oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!—I dared not—I dared not speak! 
 I heard them—many, many days ago—yet I dared not—I dared not speak! 
 As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell, the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws. 
 The wife had discovered an intrigue between her husband and their former French governess, and declared that she would not continue to live under the same roof with him. 
 They all felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that any group of people who had met together by chance at an inn would have had more in common than they. 
 On the third day after his quarrel with his wife, Prince Stephen Arkadyevich Oblonsky – Steve, as he was called in his set in Society – woke up at his usual time, eight o'clock, not in his wife's bedroom but on the morocco leather-covered sofa in his study. 
 'Let me see what was it?' he thought, trying to recall his dream. 
 Oh yes, Darmstadt was in America, – and Alabin was giving the party. 
 And then he suddenly remembered that, and why, he was not sleeping there but in his study. The smile vanished from his face and he frowned. 
 And the details of his quarrel with his wife, his inextricable position, and, worst of all, his guilt, rose up in his imagination. 
 That's the tragedy of it!' he thought. 'Oh dear, oh dear!' he muttered despairingly, as he recalled the most painful details of the quarrel. 
 And, as often happens, it was not so much the memory of the event that tormented him, as of the way he had replied to her. 
 He repented only of not having managed to conceal his conduct from her. 
 He might perhaps have been able to hide things from her had he known that the knowledge would so distress her. 
 He had never clearly considered the matter, but had a vague notion that his wife had long suspected him of being unfaithful and winked at it. 
 He even thought that she, who was nothing but an excellent mother of a family, worn-out, already growing elderly, no longer pretty, and in no way remarkable – in fact, quite an ordinary woman – ought to be lenient to him, if only from a sense of justice. 
 Oblonsky kept repeating to himself, and could arrive at no conclusion. 'And how well everything was going on till now – how happily we lived! 
 (He vividly pictured to himself Mlle Roland's roguish black eyes, and her smile.) 'Besides, as long as she was in the house I never took any liberties. 
 He could find no answer, except life's usual answer to the most complex and insoluble questions. 
 That answer is: live in the needs of the day, that is, find forgetfulness. 
 'They're on your table,' answered Matthew with a questioning and sympathizing glance at his master – adding after a pause with a sly smile: 'Some one has called from the jobmaster's.' 
 Matthew put his hands into the pocket of his jacket, put out his foot, and looked at his master with a slight, good-humoured smile. 
 'Ask Darya Alexandrovna.' 
 Give her the telegram, and see what she says.' 
 'Never mind, sir – things will shape themselves.' 
 'What is it, Matrena?' asked Oblonsky, stepping out to her. 
 Although he was entirely guilty and was conscious of it, almost every one in the house – even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna's best friend – sided with him. 
 She suffers dreadfully; it's pitiful to see her, and everything in the house is topsy-turvy. 
 There's no joy without...' 
 Pray to Him, sir, pray to Him!' 
 'All right – now go,' said Oblonsky, suddenly blushing. 'I must get dressed,' said he, turning to Matthew, and he resolutely threw off his dressing-gown. 
 Thus Liberalism became habitual to Oblonsky, and he loved his paper as he loved his after-dinner cigar, for the slight mistiness it produced in his brain. 
 'I told you not to put passengers on the roof,' the girl shouted in English. 'Now pick them up!' 
 'Everything is disorganized,' thought Oblonsky; 'here are the children running wild –' and going to the door he called them in. 
 Having dismissed her, he took his hat and paused to consider whether he had forgotten anything. 
 'Oh yes!' His head dropped, and his handsome face became worried. 
 Hearing her husband's step she stopped and looked at the door, vainly trying to assume a severe and contemptuous expression. 
 Her eyes drooped and she waited to hear what he would say, as if entreating him to persuade her somehow that she had made a mistake. 
 'A momentary infatuation...' he said, and was going on, but at those words her lips tightened again as if with pain, and again the muscle in her right cheek began to twitch. 
 'Go away – go away from here!' she cried in a still shriller voice, 'and don't talk to me of your infatuations and all those horrors!' 
 His face broadened, his lips swelled, and his eyes filled with tears. 
 'You are horrid and disgusting to me!' she shouted, getting more and more excited. 
 To me you are detestable, disgusting – a stranger, yes, a perfect stranger!' She uttered that word stranger, so terrible to herself, with anguish and hatred. 
 She went out, slamming the door. 
 Oblonsky sighed, wiped his face, and with soft steps left the room. 'Matthew says "things will shape themselves," – but how? 
 And her shouting – it was so vulgar,' he thought, recalling her screams and the words scoundrel and mistress. 'And the maids may have heard it! 
 Seeing him in the dining-room, Oblonsky recollected a joke he had once made at the expense of this accurate baldheaded clockmaker, and he smiled. 'The German,' he had said, 'has been wound up for life to wind up clocks.' 
 Oh, and here's some money,' said he, taking a ten-rouble note out of his pocket-book. 'Will it be enough?' 
 It was her only place of refuge from household cares. 
 'Gone! But how did he finish with her?' she thought. 
 Oh, no! It's impossible to be reunited... 
 How I loved – and don't I love him now? Don't I love him more than ever? 
 Here he is!' said almost every one he met, smilingly. 
 Even if conversation with him sometimes caused no special delight, still the next day, or the next, every one was as pleased as ever to meet him. 
 He chatted and joked just as much as was proper and then turned to business. 
 The Secretary came up with the papers, cheerfully and respectfully like everybody in Oblonsky's Office, and remarked in the familiarly Liberal tone introduced by Oblonsky: 
 All the Members from beneath the Emperor's portrait and from behind the Mirror of Justice, glad of some distraction, looked toward the door; but the door-keeper at once turned out the intruder and closed the glass doors behind him. 
 When the Report had been read, Oblonsky rose, stretching himself, and, paying tribute to the Liberalism of the times, took out a cigarette before leaving the Office to go to his private room. 
 'Some man came in without permission, your Excellency, when I wasn't looking. 
 Levin came to Moscow always excited, always in a hurry, rather shy and irritated by his own shyness, and usually with totally new and unexpected views about things. 
 But the difference was that Oblonsky, doing as every one else did, laughed with confidence and good humour, while Levin laughed uncertainly and sometimes angrily. 
 Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and immediately turned to Oblonsky. 
 Though Levin had great respect for his step-brother, an author known throughout Russia, he hated to be regarded not as Constantine Levin but as a brother of the famous Koznyshev. 
 'On the one hand it's simply playing! They play at being a parliament, and I am neither young enough nor old enough to amuse myself with toys. 
 On the other hand...' he hesitated, 'it is a means of getting pelf for the provincial coterie! 
 'Didn't you tell me you would never again put on Western European clothes?' he asked, surveying Levin's new suit, evidently made by a French tailor. 'That's it! 
 You know it is very, very important for me to have a talk with you,' said Levin. 
 'You spoke of two words, but I can't answer in two because... 
 'That'll be all right!' said Levin and left the room, only recollecting when already at the door that he had not taken leave of Oblonsky's colleagues. 
 He had prepared for and entered the University together with young Prince Shcherbatsky, Dolly's and Kitty's brother. 
 In his student days he very nearly fell in love with the eldest daughter, Dolly; but a marriage was soon after arranged between her and Oblonsky. 
 He had heard that women often love plain ordinary men but he did not believe it, because he judged by himself and he could only love beautiful mysterious exceptional women. 
 Or... but he dared not think what would happen if she refused him. 
 But here again it seemed to Levin that having reached the most important matter they avoided it; and he made up his mind to ask the professor a question. 
 He wanted to tell his brother of his intended marriage and to ask his advice. 
 'There now! It's always the same,' interrupted Koznyshev. 
 'Well, I don't understand that,' said Koznyshev. 'But what I do understand is a lesson in humility. 
 He therefore went to Oblonsky's office, and having received news of the Shcherbatskys he drove to the place where he was told he could see Kitty. 
 Well-dressed people, their hats shining in the sunlight, crowded at the gates and thronged the clean-swept paths between little houses built with carved eaves in Russian style. 
 There seemed to be nothing striking in her dress or attitude, but it was as easy for Levin to recognize her in that crowd as to find a rose among nettles. Everything was lit up by her. 
 She was the smile that brightened everything around. 'Can I really step down on to the ice, and go up to her?' he thought. 
 'I haven't any skates,' answered Levin, wondering at such boldness and freedom of manner in her presence and not losing sight of her for a moment although not looking at her. 
 There is a tradition here that you are the best skater,' she said, flicking off with a small black-gloved hand some hoar-frost crystals that had fallen on her muff. 
 'You seem to do everything passionately,' she remarked with a smile. 
 'You've not looked us up for a long time, sir,' said one of the attendants as, holding up Levin's foot, he bored a hole in the heel of his boot. 'Since you left we have had no gentleman who is such a master at it as you! 
 Shall I tell her now? But that's just why I'm afraid of speaking. 
 Now I am happy, if only in my hopes – but then?... But I must... 
 Having spoken about her old governess and her peculiarities, she asked him about his way of life. 
 O Lord, help me and teach me!' prayed Levin, and feeling at the same time a need of violent exercise, he got up speed and described inner and outer circles. 
 Just then a young man, the best of the new skaters, with a cigarette in his mouth and skates on, came out of the coffee-room, and taking a run, descended the steps leading to the lake, clattering with his skates as he jumped from step to step. 
 Nicholas Shcherbatsky called out. 
 He caught his foot on the last step, but, scarcely touching the ice with his hand, made a violent effort, regained his balance, and skated away laughing. 
 'Can I really be guilty – have I really done anything wrong? 
 I know it's not him I love, but still I feel happy with him, he is so charming! 
 'Yes, yes! Let's go,' answered the happy Levin, still hearing the voice saying: 'Au revoir!' and still seeing the smile with which it had been said. 
 'Have you a sledge?... 
 'If you please, your Excellency,' he said, turning to Levin and as a mark of respect to Oblonsky paying attention to his guest. In a moment he had spread a fresh cloth on a round table already covered with a cloth beneath a bronze chandelier, moved two velvet chairs to the table, and stood with a napkin and menu awaiting the order. 
 'They may be Flensburg, but are they fresh?' 
 Don't think that I do not appreciate your choice,' he added, noticing a dissatisfied look on Oblonsky's face. 
 'I should think so! Say what you like, it is one of the pleasures of life!' said Oblonsky. 
 And your special cheese?' 
 'Yes, I noticed that poor Grinevich's nails interested you greatly,' said Oblonsky. 
 We try to get our hands into a state convenient to work with, and for that purpose we cut our nails and sometimes roll up our sleeves. 
 He remembered his brother Nicholas and frowned, feeling ashamed and distressed; but Oblonsky started a subject which at once distracted his thoughts. 
 Come, bring us the soup, my good fellow!... It's her grande dame manner,' said Oblonsky. 
 'I shall come too, but I must first go to a musical rehearsal at the Countess Bonin's. 
 '-"Fiery steeds by" something "brands / I can always recognize / Youths in love at once I know, / By the look that lights their eyes! "-' declaimed Oblonsky. 'You have everything before you!' 
 'No, not behind me, but you have the future and I have the present; and even that only half-and-half!' 
 However, I don't want to talk about myself, and besides it's impossible to explain everything,' said Oblonsky. 'Well, and why have you come to Moscow?... 
 'No, wait, wait!' he said. 'Understand that for me it is a question of life and death. 
 Now you and I are quite different in everything – in tastes and views and everything – but I know you like me and understand me, and so I am awfully fond of you. 
 She sees people through and through! But more than that, she knows what is going to happen especially in regard to marriages. 
 No one would believe it, but as it turned out she was right. And she is on your side.' 
 I have been in love but this is not the same thing. It is not my feeling but some external power that has seized me. 
 You can't imagine what you have done for me by saying what you did! 
 I am so happy that I'm acting meanly. I've forgotten everything. 
 'Ah, but all the same,' said Levin, 'looking back at my life, I tremble and curse and bitterly regret... 
 'There is one thing more that I must tell you,' began Oblonsky. 'You know Vronsky?' 
 'Another bottle!' said Oblonsky, turning to the Tartar, who was filling their glasses and hovering round them just when he was not wanted. 
 'You just wait a bit, wait!' said Oblonsky, smiling and touching Levin's arm. 'I have told you what I know, and I repeat that, as far as anyone can judge in so delicate and subtle a matter, I believe the chances are all on your side.' 
 His personal feelings had been desecrated by the mention of some Petersburg officer as his rival, and by Oblonsky's conjectures and advice. 
 Tell me quite frankly...' He took out a cigar, and with one hand on his glass he continued: 'Give me some advice.' 
 Supposing you were married and loved your wife, but had been fascinated by another woman... 
 ['It is heavenly when I have mastered my earthly desires; but when I have not succeeded, I have also had right good pleasure!'] 
 Oblonsky repeated these lines with a subtle smile and Levin himself could not help smiling. 'No, but joking apart,' continued Oblonsky, 'just consider. 
 A woman, a dear, gentle, affectionate creature, poor and lonely, sacrifices everything. 
 Now when the thing is done... just consider, should one forsake her? Granted that one ought to part with her so as not to destroy one's family life, but oughtn't one to pity her and provide for her and make things easier?' 
 And then all of a sudden love crosses your path, and you're lost, lost!' said Oblonsky with despair. 
 And the reason is this: I think love, both kinds of love, which you remember Plato defines in his "Symposium" – both kinds of love serve as a touchstone for men. 
 Those who understand only the non-platonic love need not speak of tragedy. 
 "Thank you kindly for the pleasure, good-bye," and that's the whole tragedy. 
 Here Levin recollecting his own sins and the inner struggle he had lived through added unexpectedly, 
 For instance you despise public service because you want work always to correspond to its aims, and that never happens. 
 And immediately in conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky felt relief and rest after the talk with Levin, who always demanded of him too great a mental and spiritual strain. 
 PRINCESS KITTY SHCHERBATSKAYA WAS EIGHTEEN, and this was her first season. 
 'It's a good thing he is so unattractive, and that Kitty has not fallen in love with him,' thought her mother. 
 Vronsky satisfied all the mother's desires: he was very rich, clever, distinguished, with a brilliant military career before him, a position at Court, and altogether was an enchanting man. 
 Afterwards at an appointed time and place the expected proposal was made to, and accepted by, her parents. 
 At least so it seemed to the Princess. But in her daughters' case she experienced how far from easy and simple the apparently easy business of marrying off a daughter really was. 
 What anxiety she had to suffer, how many questions to consider over and over again, how much money to spend, how many encounters with her husband to go through; when her two elder daughters Darya and Nataly were married! 
 The Princess had grown used to this in respect to her older daughters, but now she felt that her husband's punctiliousness had more justification. 
 But how marriages are now arranged the Princess could not find out from anyone. 
 The French way, of parents deciding a daughter's fate, was not accepted, and was even condemned. 
 She was afraid that her daughter who had once seemed to have a certain affection for Levin might be led by an exaggerated feeling of loyalty to reject Vronsky, and she feared that in general Levin's arrival might cause complications and delays in matters now so near conclusion. 
 'There is one thing I want to say...' the Princess began, and from her serious look Kitty guessed what was coming. 
 'So it's to be!' thought Kitty and the blood rushed to her heart. Glancing at the mirror she was horrified at her pallor. 
 She felt sure that he had come so early on purpose to see her alone and to propose to her. 
 She was already approaching the door when she heard his step. 
 Besides, it's impossible to feel awkward with him. Here he is!' she thought, as she saw his powerful diffident figure before her and his shining eyes gazing at her. 
 'I told you that I did not know how long I should stay... that it depends on you.' 
 Her head dropped lower and lower, knowing the answer she would give to what was coming. 
 'That it would depend on you,' he repeated. 'I want to say... 
 She remembered Vronsky, lifted her clear, truthful eyes to Levin's face, and noticing his despair she replied quickly: 
 An expression of terror appeared in her face on seeing them alone together and noticing their troubled looks. Levin bowed to her and said nothing. 
 Her constant and favourite amusement was to make fun of him. 
 Awkward as it would have been for Levin to leave just then, he would have preferred doing so to remaining in the house for the rest of the evening in sight of Kitty, who now and then glanced at him but avoided catching his eye. 
 'Something out of the common has happened to him,' thought the Countess Nordston, scrutinizing his stern and serious face; 'why does he not start on one of his discourses? 
 There are people who when they meet a rival, no matter in what, at once shut their eyes to everything good in him and see only the bad. 
 Everything about his face and figure – from his black closely-cropped hair and freshly-shaven chin to his wide, brand-new uniform – was simple and at the same time elegant. Having stepped aside to let a lady pass, Vronsky approached first the Princess and then Kitty. 
 'Let me introduce you,' said the Princess indicating Levin. 'Constantine Dmitrich Levin, Count Alexis Kirilovich Vronsky.' 
 'I was to have dined with you earlier this winter,' he said with his simple frank smile, 'but you unexpectedly went away to the country.' 
 'No, not when one is busy: nor need one be dull in one's own company,' replied Levin abruptly. 
 'Nowhere have I felt so homesick for the country, our Russian country, with its peasants in bark-shoes, as when I spent a winter with my mother in Nice. 
 He was addressing both Kitty and Levin, his quiet and friendly glance passing from the one to the other. He was evidently speaking quite sincerely and frankly. 
 The conversation touched on table-turning and spiritualism, and the Countess Nordston, who believed in spiritualism, began relating miracles she had witnessed. 
 'Ah, Countess, you must really take me there. For goodness' sake take me to them! 
 They believe in the evil eye and spells and witchcraft, while we...' 
 But the Spiritualists on the contrary began by the tables writing for them and the spirits coming to them, and they only afterwards began to say that it was an unknown force.' 
 'For this reason,' Levin again interrupted him, 'that with electricity, you need only rub a piece of resin against wool, and you will always produce a certain phenomenon, but this other does not always act, so it is not a natural force.' 
 'Let us try now, Countess,' he began, but Levin wanted to finish saying what he thought. 
 She pitied him with her whole soul, especially because she herself had caused him to suffer. 'If you can forgive me, please do,' pleaded her look. 
 He embraced Levin, and speaking to him did not catch sight of Vronsky who rose and stood quietly waiting until the Prince should notice him. 
 As soon as the old Prince had turned away from him Levin went out unobserved, and his last impression was Kitty's happy smiling face as she answered Vronsky's question about the ball. 
 'It is a pity, a pity, but I am not to blame,' she said to herself, but an inner voice said something different. 
 'Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy,' she repeated to herself till she fell asleep. Meanwhile below in the Prince's little study her parents were having one of their frequent scenes about their favourite daughter. 
 This one is a little Petersburg fop. They are machine-made by the dozen, all to one pattern, and all mere rubbish. 
 'I know this much,' the Princess interrupted him, 'that if I were to listen to what you say we should never see our daughter married, and we had better go and live in the country.' 
 'And you'll find it out, but too late, just as with poor Dolly.' 
 'All right. All right, don't let's talk,' said the Princess, interrupting him and remembering the unfortunate Dolly. 
 And having made the sign of the cross over one another and kissed, feeling that each of them retained their individual opinions, the couple separated for the night. 
 He would not have believed that what gave so much and such excellent pleasure to him, and – what was more – to her, could be wrong. 
 I feel myself better and purer, I feel I have a heart and that there is much that is good in me. 
 It's pleasant for me and for her,' and he considered where he should finish his evening. 
 That's just what I like about the Shcherbatskys', that I myself become better there. I'll go home.' 
 He went straight to his rooms at the Hotel Dusseau, had supper, and after undressing had hardly laid his head on his pillow before he was fast asleep. 
 'My mother,' replied Vronsky, shaking hands and smiling (as everybody did when meeting Oblonsky) as they went up the steps together. 'She is coming from Petersburg to-day.' 
 'Home,' replied Vronsky. 'To tell you the truth I felt in such a pleasant mood when I left the Shcherbatskys' that I did not care to go anywhere else.' 
 Besides liking Oblonsky, as everybody did, Vronsky latterly had felt still more drawn to him because he was connected in his mind with Kitty. 
 'Well, are we to give a supper to the diva next Sunday?' he asked smilingly, taking Oblonsky's arm. 
 'I don't know how it is that all Muscovites, present company of course excepted,' Vronsky put in jokingly, 'are so abrupt. 
 'No,' said Oblonsky who was anxious to tell Vronsky about Levin's intentions concerning Kitty, 'no, you have not judged my Levin rightly. 
 The engine with the tender behind it moved slowly into the station, gradually slowing down and making the platform tremble still more. Then came the luggage van in which a dog was whining, and at last the passenger coaches, oscillating before they stopped. 
 His words roused Vronsky from his reverie and reminded him of his mother and of the coming meeting. 
 'You had my telegram? 
 'Au revoir, Ivan Petrovich, and please if you see my brother send him to me,' said the lady, closing the door and again entering the compartment. 
 'Excuse my not recognizing you before. Our acquaintance was so slight,' he said with a bow, 'that I am sure you do not remember me.' 
 'I don't know what you mean, maman,' the son replied coldly. 'Well, shall we go?' 
 'No, no,' said the Countess holding her hand,' I could travel round the world with you and not be dull. 
 But please don't fret about your son, you can't expect never to be parted.' 
 I hardly noticed how the time passed. 
 Conventional as the phrase was, Mrs. Karenina evidently believed it and was pleased. 
 She blushed, stooped a little, and held out her face for the Countess to kiss, then she stood up again, and with the same smile hovering between her lips and eyes held out her hand to Vronsky. 
 He pressed the little hand, and the firm grip with which she shook his gave him unusual pleasure. 
 And she began to tell about what interested her most, her grandson's christening, for which she had gone to Petersburg, and the special favour the Emperor had shown to her eldest son. 
 Thrown himself under... Run over...' shouted the passers-by. 
 Oblonsky, with his sister on his arm, also turned back, and, avoiding the crowd, stood with frightened faces beside the carriage. 
 'Oh, if you had seen it, Countess,' said Oblonsky. And his wife was there... 
 'On the contrary, I think it is a very easy death, instantaneous,' said another. 
 On reaching his house, he helped his sister out of the carriage, pressed her hand, and drove off to his office. 
 WHEN ANNA ARRIVED Dolly was sitting in her little drawing-room giving a fair-haired, plump little boy (who already resembled his father) a French reading-lesson. 
 Dolly was overpowered by her sorrow and was quite absorbed by it. Nevertheless, she remembered that her sister-in-law, Anna, was the wife of one of the most important men in Petersburg, and a grande dame. 
 Thanks to that circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband, and did not forget that her sister-in-law was coming. 'After all, it is not in the least Anna's fault,' thought she. 
 If only she does not try to console me!' thought Dolly. 'All these consolations and exhortations and Christian forgivenesses, I have considered them a thousand times, and they are all no good.' 
 And when she heard soft steps and the rustle of petticoats already in the doorway, she looked round with an expression not of pleasure but of surprise on her careworn face. 
 'No, please do not let us go anywhere.' 
 She took off her shawl and her hat and, having caught it in her black and very curly hair, shook her head to disengage it. 
 She not only mentioned them all by name, but remembered the years and even the months of their births, their characters, and what illnesses they had had; and Dolly could not help appreciating this. 
 She expected now to hear words of insincere sympathy: but Anna said nothing of the kind. 
 I know they say husbands tell their wives how they have lived, but Steve...' She corrected herself. 
 He is kind-hearted, but he is proud too, and now he is so humiliated. 
 Life with him now will be a torture for me, just because I love my old love for him...' 
 'No, he understands and understood,' Dolly interrupted. 'And I... you forget me... 
 When he was speaking to me, I confess I did not quite realize the misery of your position. 
 But, Dolly dearest, I fully understand your sufferings – yet there is one thing I do not know. I do not know... 
 These men may be unfaithful, but their homes, their wives, are their holy places. 
 I should not remain the same woman – no, but I should forgive, and forgive it as utterly as if it had never happened at all.' 
 Well now, I will show you your room.' She rose, and on the way embraced Anna. 
 'My dear, how glad I am you came! I feel better now, much better.' 
 'Steve,' she said to him with a merry twinkle in her eye and making the sign of the cross over him as she indicated the door with a look. 'Go, and may God help you.' 
 'Now how were we sitting before?' said Anna, resuming her seat. 
 'I know something – Steve told me and I congratulate you. I like him very much,' Anna continued. 
 'Steve let it all out to me, and I shall be very pleased. I travelled yesterday with Vronsky's mother,' she continued, 'and she talked about him all the time. 
 Well, thank heaven Steve is stopping a long time with Dolly,' she added changing the subject, and she rose, dissatisfied with something, Kitty thought. 
 'All together!' said Anna laughing and running to meet them, and putting her arms round them she tumbled the whole heap of children – struggling and shrieking joyfully – on to the floor. 
 'Oh, please don't trouble about me,' said Anna, scrutinizing Dolly's face and trying to discover whether a reconciliation had taken place. 
 At half-past nine an unusually pleasant and happy family conversation round the Oblonskys' tea-table was disturbed by an apparently very ordinary occurrence which yet struck them all as strange. 
 'I have her photo in my album,' said she, 'and I'll show you my Serezha's too,' she added with a mother's proud smile. 
 Seizing the first opportunity she rose and, stepping firmly and lightly, went out to fetch her album. 
 'It is too early to fetch me, and late for anyone else,' said Kitty. 
 Anna looked down from the landing where she stood and at once recognized Vronsky, and a strange feeling of pleasure mixed with fear suddenly stirred in her heart. 
 When Anna was half-way up the top flight, he lifted his eyes and saw her, and a look of something like embarrassment and fear came into his face. 
 She bowed slightly and went on. She heard Oblonsky's loud voice downstairs asking him to come in, and Vronsky's low, soft voice refusing. 
 Kitty blushed. She thought that she alone understood why he had come to the house and why he would not come in. 
 There was nothing extraordinary or strange in the fact that a man had called at half-past nine at a friend's house to ask about a dinner they were planning and that he would not come in; but it seemed strange to all of them. 
 To Anna in particular it seemed strange and not right. 
 Her dress did not feel tight anywhere, the lace around her bodice did not slip, the bows did not crumple or come off, the pink shoes with their high curved heels did not pinch but seemed to make her feet lighter. 
 There might be some possible doubt about anything else, but that ribbon was charming. 
 'It is a rest to waltz with you,' he said as he took the first slow steps of the dance. 'What lightness and precision! it's delightful!' he remarked, saying to her what he said to almost all the dancing partners whom he really liked. 
 Korsunsky bowed, straightened his broad shirt front, and offered Kitty his arm to conduct her to Anna. 
 Kitty had been seeing Anna every day and was in love with her and had always imagined her in lilac, but seeing her in black she felt that she had never before realized her full charm. 
 'You even come into the room dancing,' she said. 'She is one of my most faithful helpers,' said Korsunsky, turning to Anna whom he had not yet seen. 
 'The Princess helps to make a ball gay and beautiful. Anna Arkadyevna, shall we have a turn?' he added, stooping toward her. 
 He came up to Kitty, reminding her of the first quadrille and regretting that he had not seen her for such a long time. 
 Kitty, while gazing with admiration at Anna waltzing, listened to him, expecting him to ask her to waltz, but he did not do so and she glanced at him with surprise. 
 Kitty looked into his face which was so near her own, and long after – for years after – that look so full of love which she then gave him, and which met with no response from him, cut her to the heart with tormenting shame. 
 But while dancing the last quadrille with one of the youthful bores whom it would not do to refuse, she happened to be vis-à-vis to Anna. 
 'No, it is not the admiration of the crowd that intoxicates her, but the rapture of one, and that one is... can it be he?' Every time he spoke to Anna the joyful light kindled in her eyes and a smile of pleasure curved her rosy lips. 
 She seemed to make efforts to restrain these signs of joy, but they appeared on her face of their own accord. 'But what of him?' 
 But before the mazurka began, when the chairs were already being placed for it, and several couples moved from the small to the large ball-room, Kitty was for a moment seized with despair. 
 She had not even a hope of being asked again just because she had too much success in Society for anyone to think that she was not already engaged for the dance. 
 But although she seemed like a butterfly just settled on a blade of grass and ready at any moment to flutter and spread its rainbow wings, her heart was crushed with terrible despair. 
 'Kitty, what does this mean?' asked the Countess Nordston, coming up inaudibly over the carpet. 'I don't understand it.' 
 'He asked her for the mazurka in my presence,' said the Countess, knowing that Kitty would understand whom she meant by 'him' and 'her.' 
 And she saw them with her far-sighted eyes, she saw them close by, too; when they met in the dance, and the more she saw of them the surer she was that the blow had fallen. 
 In the middle of the mazurka, performing a complicated figure newly-invented by Korsunsky, Anna stepped into the middle of the room and chose two men and two ladies, one of whom was Kitty, to join her. 
 Anna did not wish to stay to supper, but the master of the house tried to persuade her to do so. 
 'Come, Anna Arkadyevna,' began Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm under his, 'I have such a good idea for a cotillion – Un bijou.' 
 'YES, THERE IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING OBJECTIONABLE and repellent about me,' thought Levin after leaving the Shcherbatskys, as he walked toward his brother's lodgings. 'I do not get on with other people. 
 'Yes, she was bound to choose him. It had to be so, and I have no cause to complain of anyone or anything. 
 A man of no account, wanted by no one and of no use to anyone.' And he remembered his brother Nicholas, and kept his mind gladly on that memory. 
 And have we judged brother Nicholas fairly? Of course, from Prokofy's point of view, who saw him in a ragged coat and tipsy, he is a despicable fellow; but I know him from another side. 
 He was teased and called 'Noah' and 'monk,' and then when he broke loose no one helped him, but all turned away from him with horror and disgust. 
 It was not his fault that he was born with his ungovernable temper, and with a cramped mind. He always wished to do right. 
 As he entered the doorway the stranger's voice was saying: 
 His brother's timidity obviously softened Nicholas, whose lips quivered. 
 'Ah! You have come just for that?' he said. 
 And he glanced round at everybody present as was his way. 
 So now you know whom you have to deal with, and if you fear you will be degraded – there is the door.' 
 'SO YOU SEE...' NICHOLAS LEVIN CONTINUED with an effort, wrinkling his brow and twitching. 
 He evidently found it hard to decide what to say and to do. 'Do you see...' he pointed to a bundle of iron rods tied together with string, in a corner of the room. 
 Our workmen the peasants bear the whole burden of labour, but are so placed that, work as they may, they cannot escape from their degrading condition. 
 It seems to me there is plenty of work to do in the country as it is. 
 But at that moment Kritsky called him from outside the door. 
 Only you have no business to talk to her. 
 'Well, all right, all right!... and how about supper? Ah, here it is,' he said noticing a waiter who was bringing in a tray. 
 Nicholas jerked his head and grew thoughtful. 
 How well I remember the garden-house and the sofa!... Mind, don't change anything in the house, but get married soon and set things going again as they used to be. 
 'If you want my full confession about it, I will tell you that I take no side in your quarrel with Sergius Ivanich. 
 Then, remembering his brother Nicholas, he determined that he would never allow himself to forget him again, but would watch over him, keep him in sight, and be ready to help when things went hard with him. 
 Then his brother's talk about communism, which he had taken lightly at the time, now made him think. 
 A light fell on the snow-covered space in front of the house from the windows of the room of his old nurse Agatha Mikhaylovna, who now acted as his housekeeper. 
 And obeying the latter voice he went to the corner where two thirty-six pound dumb-bells lay and began doing gymnastic exercises with them to invigorate himself. 
 The red beauty Pava, enormous as a hippopotamus, turned her back, 
 hiding her calf from the newcomers and sniffing at it. 
 'Whom could she take after, not to be good? Simon the contractor, came the day after you left. 
 He knew this to be foolish and even wrong, and contrary to his new plans, but this house was a whole world to Levin. 
 He felt that in the depth of his soul something was settling down, adjusting and composing itself. 
 And suddenly the joyous thought came uppermost: 'In two years' time I shall have two Dutch cows in my herd and Pava herself may still be alive; there will be twelve cows by Berkut, and these three to crown all – splendid!' 
 "How can you be interested in these things?" the visitor will ask. "All that interests him interests me.." 
 But who is she?' and he remembered what had happened in Moscow. 'Well, what is to be done?... 
 'She is only a dog, but she understands that her master has come back feeling depressed.' 
 I ought to understand gentlefolk by this time. 
 Stephen Oblonsky was not dining at home, but promised to be back at seven to see his sister off. 
 Anna spent the whole morning preparing for her departure: writing notes to her Moscow acquaintances, making up accounts, and packing. 
 Her eyes shone peculiarly and kept filling with tears. 'I did not want to leave Petersburg, and now I do not want to leave here.' 
 'I have one!' said Anna, and unexpectedly following her tears, a sly, humorous smile puckered her lips. 
 'Oh, how like Steve you said that,' remarked Dolly laughing. 
 'You cannot think how queerly it came about. 
 I only thought of arranging the match, and – suddenly it all came out quite differently... 
 'So I am going away having made an enemy of Kitty, of whom I am so fond. 
 Oblonsky, smelling of wine and cigars, with his face red and happy, came in late, just as she was about to start. 
 'Remember that I love and always shall love you as my best friend!' 
 She sat down beside her maid Annushka, and peered round the dimly-lit sleeping compartment. 'Thank Heaven, to-morrow I shall see Serezha and Alexis Alexandrovich again, and my good accustomed life will go on as of old.' 
 With the same preoccupied mind she had had all that day, Anna prepared with pleasure and great deliberation for the journey. 
 Anna read and understood, but it was unpleasant to read, that is to say, to follow the reflection of other people's lives. 
 But there was nothing to be done, so she forced herself to read, while her little hand toyed with the smooth paper-knife. 
 'What am I ashamed of?' she asked herself with indignant surprise. 
 She put down her book, leaned back, and clasped the paper-knife tightly in both hands. 
 She recalled the ball and Vronsky and his humble, enamoured gaze, and their relations with one another; there was nothing to be ashamed of. 
 She passed her paper-knife over the windowpane, then pressed its cold smooth surface against her cheek and almost laughed aloud, suddenly overcome with unreasoning joy. 
 She felt that her nerves were being stretched like strings drawn tighter and tighter round pegs. 
 She went out. 
 For some time she looked into his face without answering, and, though he stood in the shade she noticed, or thought she noticed, the expression of his face and eyes. 
 He spoke courteously and respectfully, but so firmly and stubbornly that she was long unable to reply. 
 The overwrought condition which tormented her before not only returned again, but grew worse and reached such a degree that she feared every moment that something within her would give way under the intolerable strain. 
 At once thoughts of home, her husband, her son, and the cares of the coming day and of those that would follow, beset her. 
 What has happened to his ears?' she thought, gazing at his cold and commanding figure, and especially at the gristly ears which now so struck her, pressing as they did against the rim of his hat. 
 She was particularly struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced when she met him. It was that ordinary well-known feeling, as if she were dissembling, which she experienced in regard to her husband, but formerly she had not noticed it, while now she was clearly and painfully conscious of it. 
 When he had got out of the train at Bologoe station to drink a glass of seltzer water and had seen Anna, he had involuntarily at once told her just what he was thinking about it. 
 When he got out of the train at Petersburg he felt, despite his sleepless night, as fresh and animated as after a cold bath. He stopped outside the carriage, waiting till she appeared. 
 Karenin's gait, the swinging of his thighs, and his wide short feet, particularly offended Vronsky, who acknowledged only his own unquestionable right to love Anna. 
 He ordered his German valet, who had run up from a second-class carriage, to get his luggage and take it home, and he himself went up to her. 
 While he was approaching her from behind he observed with joy that she became aware of his approach and was about to turn but, on recognizing him, again addressed her husband. 
 Vronsky's calm self-confidence struck like a scythe on a stone against the cold self-confidence of Karenin. 
 Our dear samovar will be in ecstasies.' (He called the celebrated Countess Lydia Ivanovna samovar because she was always getting heated and boiling over about something.) 
 Now I shan't have to dine alone,' he went on, no longer in a bantering manner. 'You can't think how I used...' 
 He ran down the stairs to her regardless of his governess's cries, and with desperate delight called out: 'Mama! Mama!' 
 'I told you it was Mama!' he shouted to the governess. 
 'I knew!' Her son, like his father, produced on Anna a feeling akin to disappointment. 
 But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, blue eyes and plump shapely legs in tight-fitting stockings. 
 Anna experienced an almost physical pleasure in feeling his proximity and his caresses, and a moral solace when she met his simple, trustful, and loving gaze and heard his naive questions. 
 She unpacked the presents which Dolly's children had sent him, and told him that there was a girl in Moscow whose name was Tanya, who could read and even teach other children. 
 But the Countess, who was interested in everything that did not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what interested her, and she interrupted Anna: 
 She then went on to tell her of other unpleasantnesses, and of the underhand opposition to the plan for uniting the Churches, and she went away in a hurry, as she had that afternoon to be at a meeting of another society as well as to attend a Slavonic Committee meeting. 
 He entered the room, greeted everybody, and quickly sat down, smiling at his wife. 
 Before going to Moscow, she – being an adept at dressing on comparatively little money – left three dresses to be altered. 
 Exactly at half-past nine there was a ring at the front door, and he entered the room. 
 'Here you are at last!' she said, holding out her hand to him. He kissed it, and seated himself beside her. 
 Having finished his second cup of tea and cream and his bread and butter, he rose and went into his study. 
 She knew that in spite of his time being almost entirely absorbed by the duties of his post, he considered it incumbent on him to follow everything of importance that appeared in the world of thought. 
 Arriving home from the station about noon, Vronsky recognized a hired brougham at the front door. 
 'Vronsky! Bravo!' exclaimed Petritsky jumping up and noisily pushing back his chair. 
 'You have returned from a journey?' said the Baroness. 
 'Oh, I'll be off home this very moment if I am in the way.' 
 'But after dinner there is no merit in it! Well then, I'll give you some coffee... 
 Whatever am I to do?' 
 In his Petersburg world people were divided into two quite opposite sorts. 
 The coffee never got made, but boiled over and splashed everybody, effecting just what was required: that is, it gave an excuse for much noise and laughter, staining the valuable carpet and the Baroness's dress. 
 'Now good-bye, or you'll never get washed, and on my conscience will lie the greatest crime of a gentleman – want of cleanliness... 
 His tailor and another creditor were threatening him with arrest. 
 Listening to Petritsky's familiar tales, in the familiar surroundings of the house he had lived in for three years, Vronsky experienced the satisfaction of returning to his customary careless Petersburg life. 
 'And he is still as stupid and self-satisfied? And what of Buzulukov?' 
 'Oh, about Buzulukov there is such a tale – splendid!' shouted Petritsky. 'You know his passion for balls? 
 He never misses a single Court ball. He went to a grand ball wearing one of the new helmets – have you seen the new helmets? 
 But you are not listening.' 
 They wink at him, nod, frown, to make him give it up... 
 The other snatches it away and hands it to the Grand Duchess. 
 "Here, this is one of the new ones," says the Grand Duchess, turning it over, and – just fancy! – out tumbles a pear and sweets – two pounds of them!... The dear fellow had collected them in his helmet!' 
 TOWARD THE END OF THE WINTER a consultation was held at the Shcherbatskys' which was intended to ascertain the state of Kitty's health and to decide what should be done to restore her failing strength. She was ill, and with the approach of spring grew worse. 
 Their own doctor prescribed cod-liver oil, then iron, and then nitrate of silver, but as none of them did her any good and as he advised her to go abroad for the spring they sent for a celebrated specialist. 
 The doctor meanwhile found it hard not to show his contempt for the old fellow, and with difficulty descended to the level of his comprehension. 
 'In a moment, Princess. I will just have a talk with my colleague, and then I shall have the honour of giving you my opinion.' 
 When the doctors were alone, the family doctor began timidly to express his opinion, which was that a tuberculous process had begun, but... etc. 
 But we may suspect it; and there are indications – a bad appetite, nervous excitability, and so on. 
 And the celebrity explained his plan of a treatment with Soden Water, the chief reason for prescribing this evidently being that it could do no harm. 
 However, let them go.' 
 And the mother, followed by the doctor, entered the room in the middle of which Kitty was standing. Her thin cheeks were flushed and her eyes were burning after the ordeal she had endured. 
 'It's only the excitability of an invalid,' he said to the mother after Kitty had gone out. 'And I had finished.' 
 It was just as if something pleasant had happened when the doctor had gone, and Kitty too pretended to be cheerful. 
 But if you wish to travel, let us go!' and trying to appear interested in the journey she began to talk about the preparations for it. 
 'Well, how is she?' she said, entering the drawing-room without removing her bonnet. 
 Anna's soldering had not proved durable, and the family harmony had broken again at the same place. 
 The first explosion of jealousy, once past, could not be repeated. Not even the discovery of an act of infidelity could again affect her as it had done the first time. 
 I have come out to-day to hear the news, because I shall not come out at all if (which God forbid! ) it really is scarlet fever.' 
 The old Prince came out of his study after the doctor had gone, and after giving his cheek to Dolly and greeting her he turned to his wife: 
 The old Prince rose and stroked Kitty's hair. 
 'He is always out, I hardly see him,' – she could not resist adding with an ironical smile. 
 The Princess flew at her husband: 'That comes of your jokes. You always...' and she began reproaching him. 
 'She is so pitiful, poor thing, so pitiful, and you don't feel that every allusion to what has caused it hurts her. 
 Yes, and if nothing had been done that ought not to have been done, I, old as I am, would have challenged him – that fop! 
 The Prince appeared to have much more to say, but as soon as the Princess heard his tone she, as always happened in serious cases, gave in and became repentant. 
 She took off her bonnet and, having mentally rolled up her sleeves, prepared for action. 
 'No, she told me nothing about either – she is too proud. 
 Nowadays girls all want to trust to their own reason. They don't tell their mothers anything, and then... 
 She turned on her chair, blushed, and began rapidly moving her fingers, pressing now with one hand and now with the other the buckle of a belt she was holding. 
 'But I am not suggesting it... Only, tell me frankly,' said Dolly, taking her by the hand, 'did Levin speak to you?' 
 I have said and I repeat I will never, never do what you are doing – returning to a man who has betrayed you and has loved another woman. 
 You can't think what horrid thoughts I have about everything.' 
 One of these was her husband's official set, consisting of his colleagues and subordinates, who in most varied and capricious ways were connected and separated by social conditions. 
 Anna found it hard now to recall the feeling of almost religious respect she had at first felt for these people. 
 Vronsky, from the front row of the stalls, seeing his cousin, went to her box without waiting for the interval. 
 'Why did you not come to dinner?' she said, adding with a smile and so that only he could hear her: 'I am amazed at the clairvoyance of lovers! She was not there! 
 'And why did you not come to dinner?' she said admiringly. 
 'What? From Nilsson?' asked Betsy, quite horrified, though she could not have distinguished Nilsson's voice from that of a chorus girl. 
 '-"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be saved!"-' said Betsy, remembering that she had heard some one say something like that. 'Well, then, sit down and tell me about it.' 
 'IT'S RATHER IMPROPER but so charming that I long to tell it,' said Vronsky, gazing at her with laughing eyes. 'I shan't mention names.' 
 They see that a pretty woman in a hired sledge is passing them, looking at them, and laughing and nodding to them – at any rate they think so. 
 'How do you know he had "sausage-shaped whiskers," as you say?' 
 It turns out that the happy couple are a Titular Councillor [A modest rank in the Civil Service.] and a Titular Councilloress! 
 And you must remember that one of the hobbledehoys is standing there, and I have to reconcile them! Again I set my diplomacy going, and again, just as the whole business should be concluded, my Titular Councillor flies into a rage, gets red, his sausages stick out, and again I dissolve into diplomatic subtlety.' 
 These officers, in their sledge, raced after her; she became frightened, and feeling still more unwell ran up the stairs to her flat. 
 Wenden himself, having returned from his office and hearing the front-door bell and voices, went out, saw the tipsy officers with the letter, and hustled them out. 
 Vronsky realized how ungrateful a task it was – that a duel was out of the question, and that everything must be done to soften the Titular Councillor and hush up the affair. 
 After discussing the matter, they decided that Vronsky should go with Petritsky and Kedrov to apologize to the Councillor. 
 It's impossible to say anything new about her,' said a stout, red-faced, fair-haired lady who wore an old silk dress and had no eyebrows and no chignon. 
 'But I will try, if you will give me a theme. 
 'Don't you think there is something Louis Quinze about Tushkevich?' said the attaché, glancing at a handsome, fair-haired young man who stood by the tea-table. 
 This conversation did not flag, since it hinted at what could not be spoken of in this room, namely, at the relations existing between Tushkevich and their hostess. 
 Every one had something disparaging to say about the unfortunate Maltyshcheva, and the conversation began crackling merrily like a kindling bonfire. 
 I have learnt from those – what is their name? – the bankers... They have some splendid engravings. 
 I can't afford thousand-rouble sauces.' 
 'Well, why not? Grimm has a fable called "The Man Without a Shadow" – about a man who lost his shadow as a punishment for something or other. 
 'A murrain on your tongue!' suddenly remarked the Princess Myagkaya, hearing these words. 'Anna Karenina is a splendid woman. 
 I have no choice. 
 'But I don't even think of blaming her!' Anna's friend said, justifying herself. 
 Having snubbed Anna's friend handsomely, the Princess Myagkaya rose with the ambassador's wife and joined those at the table, where there was a general conversation about the King of Prussia. 
 'Ah! Here you are at last!' she added, smilingly addressing Vronsky as he entered the room. 
 'All right, I won't – especially as everybody knows those horrors!' 
 'I think,' replied Anna, toying with the glove she had pulled off, 'I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.' 
 She exerted all the powers of her mind to say what she ought; but instead she fixed on him her eyes filled with love and did not answer at all. 
 'Only don't change anything. Leave everything as it is!' he said with trembling voice. 
 'Your Hotel Rambouillet is in full muster,' said he, glancing round the whole company, 'the Graces and the Muses.' 
 'This is becoming indecent!' whispered a lady, indicating by a glance Vronsky, Anna, and Anna's husband. 
 Only Karenin did not once glance that way and was not distracted from the interesting conversation in which he was engaged. 
 'Oh yes!' said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a single word of what Betsy was saying; and going across to the big table she joined in the general conversation. 
 Only one happiness is possible for me in life, the word you so dislike – yes, love...' 
 With the book under his arm he went upstairs; but to-night, instead of his usual thoughts and calculations about his official affairs, his mind was full of his wife and of something unpleasant that had happened concerning her. Contrary to his habit he did not go to bed, but with his hands clasped behind his back started pacing up and down the rooms. 
 Karenin was being confronted with life – with the possibility of his wife's loving somebody else, and this seemed stupid and incomprehensible to him, because it was life itself. 
 He had lived and worked all his days in official spheres, which deal with reflections of life, and every time he had knocked up against life itself he had stepped out of its way. 
 What decision?' he asked himself in the drawing-room, and could find no answer. 'But after all,' he reflected before turning into her room, 'what is it that has happened? 
 But that consideration which formerly had weighed so much with him now had neither weight nor meaning. 
 'Well then,' thought he, 'the question of her feelings and so on are questions for her conscience, which cannot concern me. 
 That movement – a bad habit of cracking his fingers – always tranquillized him and brought him back to that precision of mind which he now so needed. 
 Anna said what came into her head, and hearing her own words was astonished at her capacity for deception. 
 More than that, he knew from her tone that she was not ashamed of this, but seemed to be saying frankly: 'Yes, it is closed, and so it should be and will be in future.' 
 Your too animated conversation to-night with Count Vronsky' (he pronounced the name firmly and with quiet deliberation) 'attracted attention.' 
 As he spoke he looked at her laughing eyes, terrible to him now in their impenetrability, and felt the uselessness and idleness of his words. 
 Karenin paused and rubbed his forehead and eyes. 
 What next?' said she quietly and mockingly. 'I am even listening with interest because I should like to understand what it is all about.' 
 As she spoke she wondered at her quietly natural tone and at her correct choice of words. 
 I repeat – perhaps my words may seem quite superfluous to you; perhaps they result from a mistake of mine. 
 Anna got into her bed, and every moment expected that he would address her. 
 Like an ox he waited submissively with bowed head for the pole-axe which he felt was raised above him. 
 Pale, with trembling lower jaw, he stood over her, entreating her to be calm, himself not knowing why or how. 
 Yes! These kisses were what had been bought by their shame! 
 'What bliss?' she said with disgust and horror, and the horror was involuntarily communicated to him. 'For heaven's sake, not another word!' 
 He could not find peace, because he had so long dreamed of family life and felt so ripe for it, but was still unmarried and further than ever from marriage. 
 He himself felt painfully what all those around him felt too, that it is not good for a man of his age to be alone. 
 The place was unoccupied, and when in imagination he tried to put one of the girls he knew there, he felt that it was quite impossible. 
 The painful memories became more and more covered over by the commonplace but important events of country life. 
 This lovely spring roused Levin still more and confirmed him in the determination completely to renounce the past in order to fashion his solitary life firmly and independently. 
 He was so successful in persuading his brother, and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him, that he was satisfied with himself in this respect. 
 During the last weeks of Lent the weather had been clear and frosty. 
 After he had for a while admired his cows, all familiar to him to the minutest detail, Levin gave orders for them to be driven into the field and for the calves to be let out into the yard. 
 He sent for the carpenter, who was under contract to be with the threshing-machine, but it turned out that he was mending the harrows, which should have been mended the week before Lent. 
 It was vexing that the careless farm management, against which he had struggled so many years with all his might, still continued. 
 'Tell me what I keep you for!' he shouted; but remembering that this would not help matters, he stopped in the middle of what he was saying and only sighed. 
 Levin understood very well that 'might begin sprouting' meant that the English seed-oats were already spoiling. Here again his orders had not been obeyed. 
 The foreman listened attentively and evidently tried to approve of his master's plans: but his face still wore that hopeless and despondent expression so familiar to Levin. 
 This expression seemed to say, 'That's all very well, but it will be as God wills.' 
 But don't I know,' he added laughing, 'that you always want less of everything and worse? However, this year I will not let you have your way. 
 'Then it's down in the Birch Valley that they are sowing the clover? 
 And Levin rode across the muddy yard and out of the gate into the field at a brisk amble, his fresh little horse snorting at the puddles and pulling at the bridle. 
 'It won't matter, sir, the wheat will recover.' 'Please don't argue,' said Levin, 'but do as you are told.' 
 'But the sowing, Constantine Dmitrich, is getting on first-rate,' he said making up to the master. 
 He looked at the strides Mishka took dragging the enormous lumps of earth that stuck to his feet, dismounted, took the seed-basket from Vasily, and prepared to sow. 
 It was hard walking, and having done a row Levin, wet with perspiration, stopped and gave back the basket. 
 'Why, it was you who taught us to sow it. The year before last you gave me a bushel of seed yourself. 
 He did say, "Perhaps I'll go to a watering place, or perhaps I'll come to you."-' For a moment he felt frightened and disturbed lest his brother's presence should destroy the happy frame of mind that the spring had aroused in him. 
 'Ah,' he cried, joyfully lifting both arms, 'here's a welcome guest! 
 When he returned, Oblonsky, fresh and clean, with hair brushed, and face radiant with smiles, was just coming out of his room, and they went upstairs together. 
 Oblonsky had much interesting news to tell, and one item of special interest to Levin was that his brother, Sergius Ivanich, intended to come and stay in the country with him that summer. 
 'Constantine, please leave word that if the dealer Ryabinin comes (I told him to come here to-day) they should ask him in and let him wait.' 
 A cigar is such a... not exactly a pleasure, but the crown and sign of pleasure. 
 'Perhaps it is because I am glad of what I get, and don't grieve about what I haven't,' said Levin, thinking of Kitty. 
 And really so little harm is done to anyone, and one gets so much pleasure...' 
 A hawk flew leisurely past, high above the distant forest; another followed in the same direction and vanished. 
 Listen, they're coming!' Levin almost shouted, cocking his gun. 
 Another flash, followed by a report, and the bird, flapping its wings as if trying to keep up in the air, remained stationary for a moment and then with a heavy thud fell on the swampy ground. 
 'A wretched miss with the right barrel,' replied Oblonsky, reloading. 'Hush... coming!' 
 Above his head Levin found, and again lost, stars of the Great Bear. 
 Being in the west Venus would be setting, not rising.] and all the stars of the Great Bear should be visible. 
 Venus had risen above the branch and the car of the Great Bear as well as its shafts showed clearly against the dark blue sky, but he still waited. 
 It was quite quiet in the wood, not a bird stirred. 'Let's stay a little longer,' answered Levin. 
 'She has not thought, and is not thinking, of getting married, but she is very ill and the doctors have sent her abroad. 
 'What a time they have chosen to talk,' thought she. 'And there it comes flying... 
 It belongs to both!' cried Levin, and ran into the thicket with Laska to look for the bird. 'Oh! but there was something unpleasant!' he thought. 
 'Found? good dog!' he said, taking the warm bird from Laska's mouth and putting it into his well-filled game-bag. 'We've found it, Stephen!' he shouted. 
 I'm getting a splendid price for it: thirty-eight thousand roubles; eight at once, and the rest to be paid within six years. 
 'And it will not yield more than ten sazhens of wood to the desyatina... and he is paying me at the rate of two hundred roubles.' 
 Levin smiled contemptuously. 
 'Come, don't get so carried away,' said Oblonsky piteously. 'Why did no one offer more?' 
 He would not consider a deal which would bring him in ten or fifteen per cent; he waits till he can buy at a fifth of the value.' 
 'Would you like to go into my study?' said Levin, frowning moodily, and addressing Oblonsky in French. 'Go into the study, you can talk things over there.' 
 Absolutely everything nowadays goes before a jury, everything is judged honourably, there's no possibility of stealing. 
 If you have, there's no use bargaining, but if not,' said Levin, 'I will buy the forest myself.' 
 'If you please, the forest is mine,' he said, rapidly crossing himself and holding out his hand. 'Take your money, the forest is mine. 
 That's the way Ryabinin does business, no fussing about kopeks,' he said, frowning and flourishing his pocket-book. 
 'If I were you I should not be in a hurry to take it,' remarked Levin. 
 Why, I am making this purchase, believe me, just for the honour and glory of the thing, so that it should be Ryabinin and not another that has bought Oblonsky's forest. 
 'Oh, these gentlefolks!' he remarked to his clerk while hooking up the leather apron of the cart, 'regular objects!' 
 But it hurts me to see this impoverishment as a result of, – shall I call it simplicity? 
 'Yes, yes, there are all sorts of improvements in everything now,' said Oblonsky with a moist and beautiful yawn. 'In the theatres for instance and all places of amusement... 
 He yawned, but only with his jaw, without opening his mouth. 
 'Does he, or does he not know that I proposed?' thought Levin, looking at him. 'Yes, there is something sly and diplomatic in his face,' and feeling himself blush, he gazed in silence straight into Oblonsky's eyes. 
 I agree with you,' said Oblonsky sincerely and cheerfully, though he felt that Levin ranked him with those who could be bought for silver. 
 Vronsky was aware of this attitude of his comrades toward him, and besides liking the life felt bound to justify their view of him. 
 They already prepared lumps of mud to pelt her with in due time. 
 Most of the older people and of those highly-placed regretted this impending social scandal. 
 Besides his military and social interests Vronsky had another one, namely horses, of which he was passionately fond. 
 That year there was to be an officers' steeplechase, and Vronsky had put down his name, bought an English thoroughbred mare, and, in spite of his love, was passionately, though restrainedly, concerned about the coming races. 
 It was not necessary for him to train very strictly as his weight was just the regulation eleven-and-a-half stone, but he had to be careful not to get fatter and therefore avoided sweets and starchy foods. 
 He sat waiting with his elbows on the table and his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat, and while waiting for the beefsteak he had ordered he looked at the pages of a French novel that lay on his plate. 
 Vronsky glanced at them, frowned, and, as if he had not noticed them, turned his eyes on his book and began to eat and read at the same time. 
 'That is wise, Alexis,' said the captain in a loud baritone, 'eat now, and drink one small glass.' 
 He sat down beside Vronsky, and his legs, encased in tight riding-breeches, being too long for the size of the chair, bent at a sharp angle at the hip and knee-joints. 
 Yashvin, a gambler, a rake, a man not merely without principles but with bad principles, was Vronsky's best friend in the regiment. 
 Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin, particularly because he felt that the latter liked him, not for his name and money but for himself. 
 Vronsky did not talk to him of his love, but was aware that he knew all about it and understood it rightly, and it was pleasant to him to read this in Yashvin's eyes. 
 'Tereshchenko! Vodka and pickled cucumbers for your master!' he shouted, evidently enjoying the sound of his own voice. 
 He went to the partition door, held up his hands, and began singing in French, ' "There was a king in Thule!" Vronsky, will you have a drink?' 
 Petritsky, still singing, winked his eyes and pouted as if to say, 'We know what sort of Bryansky it is.' 
 That is the question!' declaimed Petritsky with solemnity, moving his finger upwards from his nose. 
 Why get angry? 
 If you had emptied four bottles a head as we did last night, you would not know where you were lying. 
 A lean Englishman in top boots and a short jacket, with only a tuft of beard left under his chin, came to meet him with the awkward gait of a jockey, swaying from side to side with his elbows sticking out. 
 'All right, sir,' came the answer from somewhere inside the man's throat. 'Better not go in,' he added, touching his cap. 
 'I have put a muzzle on her, and she is fidgetty. Better not go in, it excites the mare.' 
 He knew it was Gladiator, but like one who avoids seeing another's open letter, he turned and went to Frou-Frou's box. 
 Mak... I never can pronounce his name,' said the Englishman over his shoulder, pointing with his black-nailed thumb to Gladiator's box. 
 The mare is nervous,' he added, nodding toward the closed horsebox before which they were standing, and from which was heard the trampling of hoofs among the straw. 
 She was slenderly built. Her chest, though well arched, was narrow. 
 This was her thoroughbred quality – the kind of blood that tells, as they say in English. 
 Her whole appearance, more especially about the head, was spirited yet gentle. 
 'Oh, you darling!' said Vronsky, stepping toward the horse and soothing her. 
 'Be quiet, darling, be quiet!' he said, again stroking her flank, and left the box with a joyful conviction that the horse was in the very best condition. 
 'How often have I been asked that question to-day?' he thought, and blushed, a thing he rarely did. 
 'The chief thing before a race is to keep cool: don't be put out or upset.' 
 If it were an ordinary empty Society intrigue they would let me alone. 
 It was a feeling of revulsion against something, against Karenin, or against himself or against the whole world – he hardly knew which. 
 Yes, this must be brought to an end,' he decided. 
 In his presence they talked as acquaintances. 
 And the boy really felt that he could not understand this relation. He tried but could not make out what he ought to feel toward this man. 
 The presence of that child always aroused in Vronsky that strange feeling of unreasoning revulsion which had of late come to him. 
 This child with his naive outlook on life was the compass which showed them their degree of divergence from what they knew, but would not recognize, as the right course. 
 But just as he was going to step toward her, she felt his nearness, pushed away the can, and turned her hot face toward him. 
 'No, I am quite well,' she said, rising and firmly pressing his outstretched hand. 'I did not expect you.' 
 'I am alone and was expecting Serezha. He went for a walk; they will return this way.' 
 Just now when he entered she was wondering why, for others, Betsy for instance (of whose secret relations with Tushkevich she knew), it was all easy, while for her it was so tormenting. 
 He noticed this, and his face assumed that submissive, slavishly-devoted expression that had such an effect on Anna. 
 'For heaven's sake!' he repeated, taking her hand. 
 'But how, Alexis, teach me how?' she said with pathetic irony at the inevitability of her position. 'Is there any escape from such a position? 
 Don't I see how suffer from everything – Society, your son, and your husband?' 
 'But he does not even know,' she said, and suddenly a vivid flush suffused her face. Her cheeks, her forehead, and her neck turned red, and tears of shame appeared in her eyes. 
 'Whether he knows or not,' said Vronsky in his usual firm, calm tone, 'that is not our business. 
 setting against him everything bad she could find in him and forgiving him nothing, on account of the terrible fault toward him of which she was guilty. 'But, Anna,' said Vronsky persuasively and gently, trying to pacify her, 'he must be told, all the same, and afterwards our action will be guided by his attitude.' 
 But she heard the voice of her son approaching, and glancing quickly round the verandah she rose hurriedly. 
 WHEN VRONSKY LOOKED AT HIS WATCH on the Karenins' verandah he was so agitated and so preoccupied that he saw the hands and face of the watch without realizing the time. 
 He only retained, as often happens, the external capacity of memory which indicated what he had decided to do next. 
 He could be in time for his own race, but, if he called on Bryansky first he could only just manage it, and the whole Court would already be at the racecourse. 
 All that was depressing in his relations with Anna, the indefiniteness that remained after their conversation, escaped from his mind. 
 He now thought with enjoyment and agitation of the race, and that after all he would be there in time, and occasionally the expectation of that night's meeting flashed brightly in his imagination. 
 The spirit of the coming races overcame him more and more as he drove further and further into their atmosphere and overtook carriages making their way to the course from Petersburg and from outlying country places. 
 Vronsky once again glanced at the beautiful fascinating shape of the mare, whose whole body was trembling, and tearing himself with difficulty from this sight he left the shed. 
 The two-verst race was nearly over, and all eyes were fixed on an officer of the horse-guards in front and on a hussar officer behind, who were urging their horses to the last limits of their strength as they neared the winning-post. 
 He ascertained that Anna, Betsy, and his brother's wife were there, but in order not to agitate himself, intentionally avoided going near them. 
 The perspiring, exhausted horses which had raced were being led away by their grooms, and one by one the fresh ones for the next race were appearing, most of them English horses, which in their hooded coverings and with their tightly-girthed stomachs looked like strange gigantic birds. 
 To the right the slender and beautiful Frou-Frou was being led up and down, stepping as on springs with her rather long elastic pasterns. 
 Feeling that he and the other riders were the centre toward which all eyes were turned, Vronsky, in the highly-strung state which generally made his movements calm and deliberate, approached his horse. 
 The Englishman puckered his lip, wishing to express a smile at anyone testing his saddling. 
 'Lead if you can, but do not despair till the last moment if you are behind.' 
 Some of the riders were in front, some behind, when Vronsky suddenly heard a horse galloping through the mud behind him, and Makhotin on his white-legged, large-eared Gladiator went past him. 
 Vronsky always disliked him and now considered him his most dangerous rival, and he was vexed with him for galloping past and so exciting Frou-Frou. 
 She broke into a canter, gave two leaps, and, angry at the tightened rein, changed back into a jerky trot, jolting her rider. 
 These particulars Vronsky learned later, now he only saw that Diana's head or legs might come just where Frou-Frou had to alight. 
 But Frou-Frou, like a falling cat, made an effort with her legs and back while in the air, and clearing the other horse rushed on. 
 The Emperor, the whole Court, and crowds of people were all looking at them – at him and at Makhotin, who was a full length ahead of him when they approached the Devil (as the solid barrier was called). 
 Excited by the fact that Gladiator was in front, the mare had risen at the barrier a little too soon and had struck it with a hind hoof. 
 Vronsky had just time to think of coming up on the outside, when Frou-Frou changed her legs and started to do so. 
 The next two obstacles, a ditch and a fence, were easily passed, but Vronsky heard Gladiator galloping and snorting closer. 
 Vronsky now had the lead, as he had wished and as Cord had advised, and he was confident of success. 
 He and Frou-Frou both saw the bank while still some way off, and to both of them came a momentary doubt. 
 'Oh, my beauty!' he thought of Frou-Frou, as he listened to what was happening behind. 'He is over it!' he thought, as he heard Gladiator again galloping behind him. 
 It was only by feeling himself nearer to the ground and by the smoothness of the pace that Vronsky knew how much the mare had increased her speed. 
 Before he could realize this, the white legs of the gelding flashed close by him and Makhotin passed at a rapid gallop. 
 Vronsky was touching the ground with one foot. 
 The mare again began to struggle like a fish, causing the flaps of the saddle to creak; she got her front legs free, but unable to lift her hind-quarters, struggled and immediately again fell on her side. 
 'Ah, ah, ah!' groaned Vronsky, seizing his head. 
 The only difference was that he was even more occupied than before. 
 As in former years, at the beginning of the spring he went abroad to recuperate his health, which was upset each year by the winter's work. 
 He who had been a considerate father, since the end of that winter had become particularly cold toward his son, and treated him in the same bantering manner as he did his wife. 'Ah, young man!' was the way in which he addressed him. 
 That was why Karenin's face bore a stern, proud expression when anyone asked about his wife's health. 
 Karenin stopped her severely, expressing the opinion that his wife was above suspicion, and from that time began to avoid the Countess. 
 Having with the mental control habitual to him considered these matters concerning his wife, he did not allow his thoughts to run on further about her. 
 He only handed Karenin the money he wanted and gave him a short account of the state of his affairs, which was not quite satisfactory, for it happened that, owing to their having been from home a good deal, more had been spent that year than usual and there was a deficit. 
 In the porch, after leaving Karenin, the doctor met Slyudin, Karenin's private secretary, whom he knew very well. 
 Without acknowledging it to himself, Karenin now looked out for opportunities of having a third person present at his interviews with his wife. 
 'And now we shall go together. Only it is a pity that I promised to go with Betsy. 
 The doctors have ordered me to walk. I will walk part way and imagine that I am still taking the waters.' 
 You have not been here before; look how pretty my verandah is,' she went on, turning now to her husband, now to Slyudin. 
 And he answered simply, though jokingly. In all this conversation nothing particular passed, but never afterwards could Anna recall this short scene without being tormented by shame. 
 Had Karenin allowed himself to observe, he would have noticed the timid, confused look which the child cast first at his father and then at his mother. 
 Karenin meanwhile talked to the governess with his hand on his son's shoulder, and Serezha felt so extremely uncomfortable that Anna saw he was about to cry. 
 'Yes,' said Karenin, and interlacing his hands he cracked his fingers. 'I also came to bring you some money, since "nightingales are not fed on fables,"-' he added. 
 Yes, I do,' she replied without looking at him, and blushing to the roots of her hair. 'But I suppose you will call here after the races.' 
 You will come back for tea, that is right!' she said, and went out beaming and gay. 
 Two men – her husband and her lover – were the two centres of her life, and without the aid of her senses she was aware of the presence of either. 
 'I am a bad woman, a ruined woman,' she thought, 'but I dislike lies. I cannot stand falsehood, but his food is falsehood. 
 He knows everything, sees everything – what then does he feel, if he can talk so calmly? 
 But no, lies and propriety is all he cares about,' said Anna to herself, without considering what she really wanted of her husband or what she would have liked him to be. 
 If England can point to the most brilliant cavalry charges in military history, it is entirely due to the fact that she has historically developed this capacity in her men and horses. 
 Karenin smiled his usual smile, which showed his teeth but expressed nothing. 
 The monstrous sports of prize-fighting, or the Spanish bull-fights, are indications of barbarism, but specialized sport is a sign of progress.' 
 'There are two sides to it,' continued Karenin, 'that of the performers and that of the spectators. 
 'Princess, a bet!' came the voice of Oblonsky from below, addressing Betsy. 'Whom are you backing?' 
 Karenin was silent while others were speaking near him, but began again immediately. 
 But at that moment the race began and all conversation ceased. 
 'Oh, I don't care,' she seemed to say to him, and then did not once look at him again. 
 But afterwards a change came over Anna's face which was positively improper. 
 She quite lost self-control. She began to flutter like a captive bird, now rising to go, now addressing Betsy. 
 Karenin approached Anna and politely offered her his arm. 'Come, if you like,' he said in French; but Anna listened to what the General was saying and did not notice her husband. 
 Betsy waved her handkerchief to him. 
 He stepped forward so as to screen her, giving her time to recover. 
 'Don't forget,' said he to her, pointing at the open window behind the coachman's box; and, slightly rising, he lifted the window. 
 She did not hear half that he said, but felt afraid of him and wondered whether it was true that Vronsky was not hurt. 
 She only smiled with simulated irony when he had finished; and she did not reply because she had not heard what he said. 
 Karenin had begun to speak boldly but when he realized clearly what he was talking about the fear she was experiencing communicated itself to him. 
 Now that a complete disclosure was impending, he expected nothing so much as that she would, as before, answer him mockingly that his suspicions were ridiculous and groundless. 
 But the expression of her frightened and gloomy face did not now even promise deception. 
 'No, you were not mistaken,' she said slowly, looking despairingly into his cold face. 'You were not mistaken. 
 I listen to you but I am thinking of him. I love him, I am his mistress, I cannot endure you, I am afraid of you, and I hate you... 
 It is dreadful, but I love to see his face, and I love this fantastic light... 
 Kitty made a low and graceful curtsy in her very simple dress – that is to say, very stylish summer gown ordered from Paris. 
 Her chief private interest at the watering-place consisted in observing those whom she did not know and making conjectures about them. 
 This Mlle Varenka was not exactly past her early youth, but seemed to be a person destitute of youthfulness: she might be nineteen years old or she might be thirty. 
 She was like a beautiful flower which though not yet in full bloom is already beginning to fade and has no scent. 
 By this contrast to herself Kitty was specially attracted. 
 'I too love you, and you are very, very sweet. I should love you still more if I had the time,' the stranger's look replied. 
 Soon after the Shcherbatskys' arrival, two new persons who provoked everybody's disapproval began to appear of a morning at the Wells. 
 But the Princess, having found out from the visitors' list that they were Nicholas Levin and Mary Ivanovna, explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her dreams about those two people vanished. 
 It seemed to her that his large, dreadful eyes, which followed her insistently, expressed hatred and irony, and she tried to avoid encountering him. 
 Kitty was walking with her mother and the Moscow Colonel, who swaggered gaily in his short, German coat, bought ready-made in Frankfort. 
 'She is wonderfully sweet!' she said, looking at Varenka. who was handing a tumbler to the Frenchwoman. 'See how naturally and sweetly she does it.' 
 'There, Mama,' said Kitty. 'And you are surprised that I admire her.' 
 The next day, watching her unknown friend, Kitty noticed that she was already on the same footing with Levin and his young woman as she was with her other protégés. 
 Choosing a moment when her daughter had gone to the Well and Varenka had stopped in front of a baker's shop, the Princess went up to her. 
 'It is more than mutual, Princess,' replied Varenka hurriedly. 
 Kitty blushed with joy, long and silently pressing her new friend's hand, which lay passively in hers. 
 Madame Stahl learnt afterwards that Varenka was not her daughter, but continued to bring her up, the more readily because it happened that very soon Varenka had no relations left. 
 'I am very glad it gives you pleasure,' said Varenka simply. 
 She only wished not to refuse, and to give Mama pleasure. 
 'No, let us sing that one.' And she sang the piece just as calmly, coldly, and well as the previous ones. 
 I will tell you,' said Varenka simply and without waiting for a reply continued: 'Yes, there is a memory attached to it and it was painful once. 
 'Worse than wrong, shameful.' 
 No, no; there are such things as looks and ways of behaving. 
 'The shame, the humiliation...' 
 But at that moment they heard the Princess's voice from the window: 
 She only knew that she had to call on Madame Berthe and get home in time for Mama's midnight tea. 
 KITTY ALSO BECAME ACQUAINTED with Madame Stahl, and this acquaintanceship, together with Varenka's friendship not only had a great influence on Kitty, but comforted her in her sorrow. 
 This was a lofty, mystical religion connected with a series of beautiful thoughts and feelings, which it was not only possible to believe because one was told to, but even to love. 
 She noticed that Madame Stahl, when inquiring about Kitty's relatives, smiled contemptuously, which did not accord with Christian kindness. 
 Trifling as these things were, they disturbed Kitty, and she felt doubts about Madame Stahl. 
 Having now clearly understood what was most important, Kitty was not content merely to delight in it, but immediately with her whole soul devoted herself to this newly revealed life. 
 She formed a plan for her future life, based on what Varenka told her about the work of Madame Stahl and of others whom she named. 
 She noticed that Kitty not only imitated Varenka's activities, but involuntarily copied her manner of walking, speaking, and blinking her eyes. 
 'Il ne faut jamais rien outrer,' [You should never overdo anything.] she said to her one day. 
 How was it possible to exaggerate, when following the teaching which bids us turn the other cheek when we are struck, and give our coat when our cloak is taken? 
 'It seems a long time since Anna Pavlovna was here,' said the Princess once, speaking of Mrs Petrova. 'I invited her and she did not seem pleased.' 
 It was one of those things which one knows and yet cannot say even to oneself – so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake. 
 She remembered her first efforts to conquer the repulsion she felt for him, as for all consumptives, and her efforts to find something to say to him. 
 The Prince, on the contrary, considered everything foreign detestable and life abroad oppressive, and kept to his Russian habits, purposely trying to appear more unlike a European than he really was. 
 Simply and naturally, as she did everything, Varenka made a movement between a bow and a curtsy and immediately began talking to the Prince just as she talked to everybody, easily and naturally. 
 'Mama is here,' said she, turning to Kitty. 'She did not sleep all night and the doctor advised her to go out. 
 'Oh, do you know her, Papa?' asked Kitty, alarmed by an ironical twinkle in the Prince's eyes when he mentioned Madame Stahl. 
 'What are Pietists, Papa?' asked Kitty, frightened by the fact that what she valued so highly in Madame Stahl had a name. 
 The man raised his straw hat above his thin curly hair, uncovering a tall forehead with an unhealthy redness where the hat had pressed it. 
 'It is Petrov, an artist,' Kitty replied, blushing. 'And that is his wife,' she added, indicating Anna Pavlovna, who on their approach went away with apparent intention, following a child who had run along the path. 
 'Well, come back then,' said Kitty, turning resolutely. 'How are you to-day?' she asked Petrov. 
 'Annetta, Annetta!' he said loudly, and the veins in his white neck protruded like thick cords. 
 'Good morning, Princess,' said Anna Pavlovna with a forced smile, quite unlike her former way of greeting Kitty. 'I am very pleased to make your acquaintance,' she went on, turning to the Prince. 
 The Prince raised his hat and went away with his daughter. 
 'Yes, Papa,' replied Kitty. 'And you know they have three children, no servants, and hardly any means. 
 'And there's Madame Stahl,' said Kitty, pointing to a bath-chair on which, under a sunshade, lay something supported by pillows, wrapped up in grey and pale-blue. 
 'Prince Alexander Shcherbatsky,' said Madame Stahl, lifting toward him her heavenly eyes, in which Kitty detected displeasure. 'I am very pleased. 
 'She does not get up, because her legs are too short. She has a very bad figure...' 
 'Evil tongues say so, my love. But your Varenka does get it,' he added. 
 'Oh, those invalid ladies!' 'Oh no, Papa,' Kitty objected warmly. 
 And by no efforts of imagination could the former Madame Stahl be recalled. 
 THE PRINCE IMPARTED HIS GOOD SPIRITS to his household, his friends, and even to his German landlord. 
 The landlord and the servants brightened up under his influence. 
 But I know all your interesting things: plum-soup and pea-sausages. I know them. 
 'No, say what you please, Prince, their institutions are interesting,' said the Colonel. 
 'It all depends on what time! 
 There are times when one would give a whole month for a shilling and there are times when you would not give half an hour at any price. 
 She was not worse, but different from what Kitty previously had imagined her to be. 
 'I will,' answered Varenka. 'They are preparing to leave, so I have promised to help them pack.' 
 'There is nothing special to tell, only Petrov used to want to leave sooner but now does not want to go,' said Varenka smiling. 
 'Well, I don't know why, but Anna Pavlovna says he does not want to go, because you are here. 
 Kitty frowned yet more, and remained silent, and only Varenka spoke, trying to soften and soothe Kitty, and foreseeing an approaching explosion of tears or words, she knew not which. 
 'It serves me right because it was all pretence, all invented and not heartfelt. 
 I cannot be different... 
 I can't live except by my own heart, but you live by principles. 
 Varenka, with her hat on, sat at the table examining the spring of her sunshade, which Kitty had broken. 
 'Varenka, forgive me, forgive me!' whispered Kitty, coming close to her. 'I don't remember what I said.' 
 She did not renounce all she had learnt, but realized that she had deceived herself when thinking that she could be what she wished to be. 
 According to his views country life was preferable to any other, and he had now come to his brother's house to enjoy it. 
 With an elder brother's condescension he sometimes explained to him the meaning of things, but could find no pleasure in discussion, because he could gain too easy a victory. 
 Constantine considered his brother to be a man of great intellect, noble in the highest sense of the word, and gifted with the power of working for the general welfare. 
 Koznyshev loved to lie basking in the sunshine, talking lazily. 
 Though Constantine was loth to crush his grass, he drove across the meadow. 
 The tall grass twined softly about the wheels and the horse's legs, leaving seeds on the wet spokes and hubs. 
 Why not, God willing? 
 Though nothing bites, it's pleasant; hunting and similar sports are good because they bring one in touch with nature... 
 We expend money for salaries, but there are no schools, no medical assistance, no midwives, no chemists, no anything!' 
 'Well, and is it not very important?' said Koznyshev, stirred by the perception that his occupations were regarded as unimportant and especially by his brother's evident inattention to what he was saying. 
 'They don't appear important to me. 
 Do what you will, they don't grip me,' replied Levin, having made out that what he saw was the steward, who was probably dismissing the peasants from their ploughing too soon, for they were turning the ploughs over. 'Is it possible they have finished ploughing?' thought he. 
 It is all very well to be a crank, to be sincere and dislike hypocrisy – I know that very well – but what you are saying has either no meaning at all or a very bad meaning. 
 Constantine felt himself morally cornered, and in consequence became excited and involuntarily betrayed the chief cause of his indifference to social questions. 
 Did we not send for the district doctor for Agatha Mikhaylovna?' 
 'Oh no! Ask anyone you like,' said Constantine, decidedly. 
 'I do,' replied Levin unguardedly, and at once realized that he had not said what he really thought. 
 'If you admit it to be good,' said Koznyshev, 'then, as an honest man, you cannot help loving and sympathizing with such movements and wishing to work for them.' 
 'You can't tell without having tried it.' 
 'Well, let's grant it is so,' said Levin, though he did not grant it at all. 'Still, I don't see why I should he bothered with it.' 
 'I don't see what philosophy has to do with it,' replied Koznyshev in a tone that made it seem – at least Levin thought so – that he did not consider his brother had a right to argue on philosophical questions. 
 I don't require doctors and medical centres; I don't need the magistrate; I never apply to him and never will. 
 'No, no!' Constantine interrupted, growing more and more heated. 
 'And to-morrow you may be going to law. Would you rather be tried in the old Criminal Court?' 
 I am not going to cut anybody's throat so I shall never be in need of that sort of thing. 
 Koznyshev only shrugged his shoulders to express his wonder at this sudden introduction of little birches into their discussion, though he had at once grasped his brother's meaning. 
 'You'd better leave philosophy alone,' said he. 'The principal task of philosophy has always, in all ages, been to find the necessary connection existing between personal and general interests. 
 But that is not the point. I need only correct your illustration to get at the point. 
 The birches are not stuck in: some of them are planted, and others are sown and have to be tended carefully. 
 Only those peoples have a future, only those peoples can be called historic, that have a sense of what is important and great in their institutions, and value them.' 
 But while walking over the meadow he recalled the impression mowing had made on him, and almost made up his mind to do it. 
 'The weather looks settled; to-morrow we begin mowing.' 
 Koznyshev looked up at his brother in surprise. 'How do you mean? 
 'But how can you dine with them? 
 'Mind!' repeated the old man. 
 By the roadside the grass was short and tough, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long time and was confused by so many eyes upon him, mowed badly for the first ten minutes, though he swung his scythe with much vigour. 
 'You are taking too wide a swath, you'll get knocked up.'... 
 'He's the master, he must work; he's working for himself'... 
 'But look how uneven!'... 
 'That's what the likes of us used to get a thump on the back for.' 
 They came to softer grass, and Levin, who was listening without replying, followed Titus and tried to mow as well as possible. 
 Levin followed, trying not to lag behind, but it became harder and harder until at last the moment came when he felt he had no strength left, and then Titus again stopped and began whetting his scythe. 
 In this way they finished the swath. 
 The only thing marring his joy was the fact that his swath was not well mown. 'I must swing the scythe less with my arms and more with the whole of my body,' he thought, comparing Titus's swath, cut straight as if by measure, with his own, on which the grass lay scattered and uneven. 
 Suddenly he was conscious of a pleasant coolness on his hot perspiring shoulders, without knowing what it was or whence it came. 
 While working he sometimes forgot for some minutes what he was about, and felt quite at ease; then his mowing was nearly as even as that of Titus. 
 But as soon as he began thinking about it and trying to work better, he at once felt how hard the task was and mowed badly. 
 He finished a swath and was about to start another when Titus paused and went up to the old man, and both looked at the sun. 
 By the time Levin had finished breakfast Koznyshev had only just got up, and Levin went back to the meadow before Koznyshev had come to table. 
 'Come, master, have some of my dinner,' said he, kneeling in front of his bowl. 
 Levin looked round and hardly recognized the place, everything was so altered. 
 He was not feeling at all tired and was only longing to work again and to accomplish as much as he could. 
 The sun had set behind the wood and now shone only on the mowers at the top of the hill, while in the valley, where the mists were rising, they were in cool, dewy shade. 
 In the wood their scythes continually cut down wood mushrooms, grown plump amid the juicy grass. 
 The old man stooped each time he came upon one, picked it up, and put it inside his jacket, saying, 'Another treat for my old woman.' 
 Levin, having regretfully taken leave of them, mounted and rode home. 
 And if I have, I'll catch it!.. 
 Though Levin had imagined that he was not hungry, and sat down to table only not to offend Kuzma, yet when he began eating he thought everything delicious. 
 'Oh, yes, there's a letter for you,' said he. 'Kuzma, please bring it. 
 Oblonsky wrote from Petersburg: 'I have had a letter from Dolly. 
 She is in Ergushevo, and everything is out of gear there. 
 'A little over twenty-five miles or maybe even thirty, but the road is excellent. 
 'I must say you have an appetite!' he said, glancing at the sunburnt ruddy face bent over the plate. 
 I sat there a little, and then went through the forest to the village, where I met your old wet-nurse and sounded her as to what the peasants think of you. 
 Don't you think so too?' replied Levin. 'If they don't like it, it can't be helped. 
 Besides, I think it's all right. 
 'Well, then, you are satisfied with your day, and so am I. First of all I solved two chess problems – one a very good one, beginning with a pawn move. 
 'What about yesterday's conversation?' asked Levin, who had finished dinner and sat blissfully blinking and puffing, quite unable to remember what yesterday's conversation had been about. 
 You may be right in thinking that activity backed by material interest is best; but your nature is altogether primesautière, [Heedless.] as the French say: you want passionate, energetic activity, or nothing at all.' 
 But what matter? I don't insist on my view,' replied Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile. 
 'How's Agatha Mikhaylovna's arm?' asked Levin, slapping his head. 'I had forgotten all about it.' 
 Meanwhile, to curtail expenses, Dolly and her children moved to the country. She went to Ergushevo, the estate which had formed part of her dowry, about thirty-five miles distant from Levin's Pokrovsk, and the very place where in spring the forest had been sold. 
 According to him it was necessary to reupholster the furniture with new cretonne, to put up curtains, make the garden tidy, plant flowers and build a bridge by the lake; but he forgot many other things which were essential, and thus caused Dolly a great deal of trouble. 
 Try as he would to be a considerate husband and father, Oblonsky never could remember that he had a wife and children. 
 Her departure for the country suited Oblonsky in every way: it was good for the children, expenses would be cut down, and he would be freer. 
 It was impossible to go for a drive because one of the horses was restive and would not run in harness. 
 Very, very rare were the short intervals of quiet. 
 Now in the country solitude she grew more often aware of these joys. 
 On the Sunday before St Peter's Day Dolly took all her children to Communion. 
 It fitted so tight round Tanya's shoulders that it was painful to see her; but Matrena Filimonovna was inspired to insert wedge-shaped pieces and to make a fichu to cover the defect. 
 On the way home the children were very quiet, feeling that something solemn had taken place. 
 Dolly would not have sanctioned any punishment on such a day had she been present, but she was obliged to support the governess and so confirmed the sentence that Grisha was not to have pudding. 
 The little fellow was sitting on the ledge of the corner window of the dancing-room, and beside him stood Tanya with a plate. 
 Still crying over the injustice done him, he ate the pudding, muttering between sobs: 'Eat some yourself... let us both eat... together!' 
 When half the children were dressed again, some smartly-dressed peasant women who had been gathering herbs came up and halted shyly by the bathing-house. 
 Matrena Filimonovna called to one of these to ask her to dry a bath-sheet and a chemise that had fallen into the water, and Dolly entered into conversation with them. 
 The peasant women, who had begun by laughing behind their hands without comprehending her questions, soon became bolder and more talkative, and at once captivated Dolly by their frank admiration of her children. 
 'Just look at the little beauty, as white as sugar!' said one, gazing admiringly at Tanya and stroking her head. 'But she's thin.' 
 And the conversation turned upon the topic that interested Dolly more than any other: confinements, children's illnesses, husbands' whereabouts, and whether they came home often. 
 What pleased Dolly most was the women's evident admiration for the great number of children she had, and their loveliness. 
 The women amused her and offended the English governess, who noticed that she was the object of their laughter, which she did not understand. 
 'You're glad, yet you never sent me word. 
 She really did not like the way Oblonsky had of forcing his family affairs upon strangers, and knew at once that Levin understood this. 
 'Of course I understood that this only meant you wanted to see me, and was very pleased. 
 Children, who will race the horses with me?' 
 Don't be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna! There's no fear of my hurting or dropping her,' said he, smiling brightly at the mother. 
 And as she looked at his easy, strong, considerate, careful and ultra-cautious movements, the mother lost her fears and looked at them with a smile of approval. 
 Here in the country among the children, and in the company of Dolly whom he found very congenial, Levin's spirits rose to that childlike merriment Dolly liked so much in him. 
 He ran about with the children, taught them gymnastics, amused Miss Hull by his broken English and talked to Dolly about his rural occupations. 
 After dinner, left alone with him on the veranda, Dolly alluded to Kitty. 
 If you insist on squaring accounts, pay me five roubles a month, if your conscience allows it.' 
 'Tell me, Constantine Dmitrich,' said Dolly with her kind though slightly ironical smile, 'why are you angry with Kitty?' 
 'All I knew was that something had happened that tormented her dreadfully, and she asked me never to speak about it. 
 'Please, please don't let us talk about it!' said he, sitting down again, conscious as he did so that a hope which he had thought dead and buried was waking and stirring within him. 
 The feeling that seemed dead was coming to life again, rising and taking possession of Levin's heart. 
 'Yes, now I understand it all,' continued Dolly. 'You can't understand it, you men who are free and have the choice. 
 'Never mind! You propose when your love is ripe or when the balance falls in favour of one of those between whom your choice lies. 
 But a girl is not asked. 
 She is expected to choose for herself, yet she has no choice; she can only say "Yes" or "No."-' 
 'Darya Alexandrovna,' said he, 'in that way one may choose a dress, or... purchases... anything... but not love. 
 I, for instance, could not have been undecided in her place. 
 To me he was always repulsive, and so he has proved in the end.' 
 'Darya Alexandrovna,' he replied drily, 'I value your confidence in me, but think you are mistaken. 
 'How funny you are!' said Dolly, regarding Levin's agitation with a sad yet mocking smile. 'Yes, I understand it more and more,' she added meditatively. 
 'You are very, very funny!' Dolly repeated, looking tenderly into his face. 
 Let it be as if nothing had been said about it.' 'What have you come for, Tanya?' said Dolly in French to her little girl, who had just come in. 
 The little girl had forgotten the French for spade, so her mother told her and went on to say, still in French, where she would find the spade. 
 Nothing in Dolly's house, or about her children seemed half as charming as before. 
 All that is needed is not to spoil or pervert children, and then they will be splendid. 
 After lengthy disputes it was settled that the peasants themselves should take those eleven stacks, counting them at fifty loads each and that the owner's share should be measured afresh. 
 These disputes and the apportioning of the haycocks went on till it was time for the evening meal. 
 'Make hay while the sun shines, and you'll have plenty,' remarked the old beekeeper, sitting down beside Levin. 'It's more like tea than hay! 
 Vanka showed her how to do this, and burst out laughing at something she said. 
 Strong, young, newly-awakened love shone in both their faces. 
 The singing women were drawing nearer to Levin and he felt as if a thundercloud of merriment were approaching. 
 Levin envied them their healthy gaiety and felt a wish to take part in that expression of the joy of living; but he could do nothing except lie and look and listen. 
 The old man who had been sitting beside him had long since gone home. 
 The peasants who lived near by had also gone home, and those from a distance had gathered together to have supper and spend the night in the meadow. 
 Levin, unnoticed by them, still lay on the haycock, looking, listening, and thinking. 
 How shall I do it?' he asked himself, trying to find expression for what he had been thinking and the feelings he had lived through in that short night. 
 This renunciation would afford him pleasure and was quite easy and simple. 
 Should he have a wife? 
 All my former dreams of a family life were nonsense – not the right thing. Everything is much simpler and better than that...' 
 There is generally a period of gloom just before daybreak and the complete triumph of light over darkness. Shivering with cold Levin walked rapidly with his eyes fixed on the ground. 
 'What's that? Who can it be coming?' thought he, hearing the tinkling of bells and raising his head. 
 That was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who might be inside he glanced in at the window absent-mindedly. 
 All that had so disturbed Levin during the sleepless night and all his resolutions vanished suddenly. 
 It answered his questioning look with the same tenderness and the same remoteness. 
 'He will get angry and won't listen to you,' they said; and in such cases the mental perturbation which tears produced in Karenin really found expression in hurried bursts of anger. 'I can do nothing for you. 
 I knew it and could see it all along, though I tried out of pity for her to deceive myself,' thought he. And it really seemed to him that he had always seen it. 
 'I ought not to be unhappy because a despicable woman has committed a crime, but I must find the best way out of this painful situation in which she has placed me. And find it I will,' said he to himself, frowning more and more. 
 The only question is, how best to face the situation.' And he began mentally reviewing the courses pursued by other men in similar positions. 
 In his youth Karenin had been particularly attracted by the idea of duelling, just because he was physically a timid man and was quite aware of it. 
 'But what is even more likely – and sure to happen – is that I should be killed or wounded. 
 My aim is to safeguard my reputation, which I need for the uninterrupted pursuit of my career.' His official pursuits, which had always appeared essential to Karenin, now assumed even greater importance. 
 Besides, it was evident that as a consequence of divorce the wife would break off relations with her husband and unite with her lover. 
 The jealousy that had tormented him during the period of uncertainty had left him when his wife's words had with great pain drawn that aching tooth. But another feeling had now taken the place of the jealousy: it was a wish that his wife's guilt should meet with retribution. 
 'It is only by this course that I can conform with religion,' said he to himself. 'It is the only way that makes it possible for me not to disown my guilty wife and to give her a chance of repenting, and even, painful as it will be, to devote part of my powers to her redemption.' 
 It was pleasant to think that no one would have a right to say that in such an important crisis in his life he had not acted in accordance with that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid general coldness and indifference. Proceeding to consider further details, Karenin could not even see why his relations with his wife should not remain almost the same as before. 
 'That is, it will restore them in so far that I shall not have this worry during the rest of my life. She must be unhappy, but I am not guilty and therefore I cannot suffer.' 
 BY THE TIME HE REACHED PETERSBURG Karenin had not only resolved to keep to his decision, but had mentally composed a letter to his wife. 
 My decision is as follows: Whatever your actions may have been, I do not consider myself justified in severing the bonds with which a Higher Power has united us. 
 A family must not be broken up through the caprice, perversity, or even crime, of one of the married couple, and our life must go on as heretofore. 
 To Karenin the splendidly painted black lace on the head, the black hair, and the beautiful white hand with many rings on the third finger, suggested something intolerably bold and provocative. 
 He was not thinking of his wife but of a complication that had recently arisen in his official activity and at present constituted the chief interest of his work. 
 A great deal of money had been and was being spent quite unproductively on that business, and it was evident that the scheme would lead to nothing. 
 After walking up and down the room he again looked at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously. 
 After he left her, she told herself that she was glad she had told him, that now everything would be definite – at any rate, the falsehood and deception would no longer exist. 
 She saw Vronsky that same evening, but did not tell him what had passed between her and her husband, though he would have to be told before her position could be settled. 
 But the words had been spoken and Karenin had gone away without saying anything. 'I saw Vronsky and did not tell him. 
 Just as he was going away I wished to call him back and tell him, but changed my mind, because my not having done so at first would have appeared strange. 
 Why did I not tell him?' And in answer to this question a hot blush of shame spread all over her face. 
 The situation which the night before had appeared to be clearing up now seemed quite hopeless. 
 She asked herself where she would go when turned out, and found no answer. 
 She had not the courage to look into the eyes of the people she lived with. She could not make up her mind to call her maid, and still less to go down and face her son and his governess. 
 Anna read the note and sighed deeply. 'I don't want anything, anything at all,' she said to Annushka, who was moving the bottles and brushes on the dressing table. 
 Anna asked, reviving suddenly, as for the first time that morning she remembered the existence of her son. 
 She must take him away. 
 She must be calm and escape from this terrible situation. 
 The thought of decided action concerned with her son – of going away somewhere with him – made her feel calmer. 
 She dressed quickly and with determined steps entered the drawing-room, where Serezha and his governess were waiting breakfast for her as usual. 
 The tears were already streaming down her cheeks, and in order to hide them she jumped up abruptly and went out on to the verandah. 
 After the thunderstorms of the last few days the weather had grown clear and cold. 
 'No, I will say nothing,' she thought, tore up the letter, re-wrote it, omitting the reference to his generosity, and sealed it. The other letter she meant to write was to Vronsky. 
 'I have informed my husband,' she began, and was unable to write any more. It seemed so coarse and unwomanly. 
 Anna looked out and saw Karenin's messenger in the porch ringing the bell. 
 'Go and see what it is,' she said, and, calmly prepared for anything, sat down in an easy-chair and folded her hands on her knees. 
 Having glanced through it, she went back and read it again from the beginning. When she had finished she felt cold, and knew that a more dreadful misfortune had befallen her than she had ever expected. 
 They do not know how for eight years he has been smothering my life, smothering everything that was alive in me, that he never once thought I was a live woman, in need of love. 
 They do not know how at every step he hurt me and remained self-satisfied. 
 But don't I know why he said it? He does not believe in my love for my son or he despises it. 
 I know him; I know that he swims and delights in falsehood as a fish does in water. But no! 
 She knew that it would be so, and yet it was so terrible that she could not even imagine how it would end. 
 That I am in love?' 
 Old Stremov – one of Petersburg's influential men, and Lisa Merkalova's adorer – was also officially hostile to Karenin. 
 As she was taking off her outdoor things in the hall she heard the footman – who even pronounced his r's like a Gentleman of the Bedchamber – say: 'From the Count to the Princess,' as he delivered the note. 
 'I have slept badly,' answered Anna, gazing at the footman, who she guessed was bringing Vronsky's note. 
 'We can have a heart-to-heart talk over our tea. We'll have a cosy chat, won't we?' she added in English, pressing the hand with which Anna held her sunshade. 
 It's just as if you thought my company might compromise you! Please bring us tea in the little drawing-room,' she said to the footman, screwing up her eyes as she always did when speaking to a footman. 
 She took the note from him and read it. 'Alexis has failed us,' she said in French. 
 Anna was aware that Betsy knew everything, but when she heard her talk about Vronsky she always felt a momentary conviction that Betsy knew nothing about it. 
 'Stremov and Lisa Merkalova are the cream of the cream of Society! They are received everywhere, and I' – she put special stress on that I – 'never was severe or intolerant: I simply have not the time.' 
 Let him and Alexis Alexandrovich break lances at their Committee Meetings; that has nothing to do with us. 
 I shall be there at six.' She closed it, and Betsy returning sent it off in her presence. 
 Over their tea, which was brought them in the cool little drawing-room, the two women really had before the arrival of the visitors the cosy chat the Princess Tverskaya had promised Anna. 
 She said that you are a real heroine for a novel, and that were she a man she would have committed a thousand follies for your sake. Stremov tells her she is committing them as it is!' 
 'It is a new fashion,' she replied. 
 They have kicked over the traces, but there are different ways of doing it.' 
 You see a thing may be looked at tragically and turned to a torment, or looked at quite simply, and even gaily. 
 'How I wish I knew others as I know myself!' said Anna, seriously and thoughtfully. 'Am I worse than others or better? 
 Betsy repeated. 'But here they come!' 
 He came into the drawing-room behind Sappho and followed her across the room as if he were tied to her, with his glittering eye fixed on her as if he were ready to eat her. 
 Vaska again bowed to Anna, but said nothing. 
 The character of her dark costume, as Anna at once noticed and appreciated, was perfectly suited to her style of beauty. Just to the same extent as Sappho was compact and spruce Lisa was limp and pliant. 
 This radiance shone out of her beautiful and really unfathomable eyes. 
 The weary yet passionate look of those eyes, with the dark circles beneath them, was striking in its perfect sincerity. 
 Looking into those eyes every one felt as if they knew her perfectly, and knowing her could not help loving her. At the sight of Anna her whole face lit up with a joyful smile. 
 I am pleased to see you!' she said, walking up to Anna. 'Yesterday at the races I was just trying to get near you when you went away. 
 'I won't go,' said Lisa, smiling and sitting down beside Anna. 
 'Bored!' said Betsy. 'Sappho said that they had a very jolly time at your house yesterday.' 
 'Oh dear! It was so dull!' said Lisa Merkalova. 
 What was there jolly about it? Do tell me how you manage not to get bored?' said she again to Anna. 
 'One has only to look at you to see that you are a woman who may be happy or unhappy, but who is not dull. Teach me how you do it!' 
 'No, but tell me why one cannot fall asleep and cannot help being bored?' 
 Having struck out the odd hundreds in order to have a round sum, counted his money and looked over his bank-book, he found that he had 1800 roubles, and there was no prospect of receiving any more before the New Year. 
 Latterly his mother, having quarrelled with him about his connection with Anna and his departure from Moscow, had stopped his allowance. 
 Having decided on this, he at once wrote a note to Rolandaki, who had more than once offered to buy his horses. 
 Then he sent for the money-lender and the Englishman, and allotted what money he had among the different bills. 
 VRONSKY WAS PARTICULARLY FORTUNATE in that he had a code of rules which clearly defined what should and should not be done. 
 These rules might be irrational and bad but they were absolute, and in complying with them Vronsky felt at ease and could carry his head high. 
 From the moment that Anna gave him her love he considered his own right to her indefeasible. 
 The only right the husband had was, weapon in hand, to demand satisfaction, and that Vronsky from the first was prepared to give him. 
 He was taken by surprise, and at the moment when she told him of her condition his heart had suggested his proposal to her to leave her husband. 
 The question of whether to leave or not to leave the army led him to another private matter – almost the chief, though the secret, interest of his life. 
 And slowly twisting his moustache he rose from the table and walked across the room. 
 'Is that where the music is?' he said, listening to the familiar strains, now audible, of brass instruments playing polkas and waltzes. 'What's up?' 
 One change Vronsky noticed in him was that quiet and permanent radiance which comes upon the faces of people who have succeeded and feel assured that everybody recognizes their success. 
 'Well, I am glad!' he said, taking him apart and pressing his hand. 
 'You look after him,' shouted the Commander to Yashvin, and went out to the soldiers. 
 Excuse me!' he added, and turned to his adjutant. 'Please give orders to distribute this money equally among the men.' 
 Serpukhovskoy was lifted and tossed by the officers. 
 Serpukhovskoy went to the dressing-room to wash his hands, and found Vronsky there. 
 He smiled because he foresaw the turn their conversation would take and was pleased. 
 'There you are! There you are!' said Serpukhovskoy, laughing. 
 'No;' said Serpukhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being suspected of such nonsense. 'Tout ça est une blague.' 
 'But why –' Vronsky named several influential men, 'why are not they independent men?' 
 'Only because they have not, or had not by birth, an independent position – had no name, were not born as near the sun as we were. 
 And they bring forward some idea, some theory (in which they themselves do not believe and which does harm) merely as a means of procuring government quarters and a salary. 
 Anyhow you and I have one great advantage: we cannot be bought so easily. 
 Vronsky realized, too, how powerful Serpukhovskoy might become by his undoubted capacity for reflection and comprehension, and by his intellect and gift of speech, so seldom met with in the Society in which he lived. 
 'All the same I lack the most necessary thing,' he replied. 
 Yes,' he said with a smile tender as a woman's, 'Give me carte blanche, leave the regiment, and I will draw you on imperceptibly.' 
 'But try to understand that I do want nothing except that everything should remain as it is,' said Vronsky. 
 'But what women!' said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress with whom these men were entangled. 
 He had often before been joyfully conscious of his body, but had never loved himself, his own body, as he did now. 
 In her presence he had no will of his own: without knowing the cause of her agitation he became infected by it. 
 He listened, involuntarily leaning forward with his whole body as if trying so to ease her burden. 
 'Yes, yes, that is better! A thousand times better! 
 She could not guess that it expressed the first idea that had entered Vronsky's mind: the thought of an inevitable duel; therefore she explained that momentary look of severity in another way. 
 The afternoon spent at the Princess Tverskaya's house had confirmed that thought. 
 Her lips trembled and her eyes seemed to him to be looking at him with strange malevolence from under the veil. 'As I was saying, that's not the point! 
 This was not what she had expected. 
 She had only his love left, and she wanted to love him. 'Try to understand that since I loved you everything has changed for me. 
 There is only one single thing in the world for me: your love! 
 I am proud of my position because... proud of... proud...' she could not say what she was proud of. 
 He also felt something rising in his throat, and for the first time in his life he felt ready to cry. 
 When the Reports had been heard, Karenin in his quiet thin voice informed the meeting that he wished to bring to their notice some considerations of his own on the question of the settlement of the native races, and the attention of the meeting turned to him. 
 Anna returned to Petersburg early in the morning, and as she had wired that the carriage should be sent for her he might have expected her. 
 Although while preparing for this interview she had been teaching herself to despise and blame him, she did not know what to say, and pitied him. There was silence for some time. 
 During that summer Levin noticed this continually. 
 He sent out the horse-rake to turn the hay and it got broken while tossing the first few rows, because the peasant found it dull to sit in the seat under the rotating wings, and Levin was told: 'Don't worry, sir! The women will toss it all in no time!' 
 Three of the best calves had been overfed by being turned into the meadow where the clover had been cut, without any water to drink; and the peasants would on no account admit that the clover had injured them. To comfort Levin he was told that his neighbour had lost a hundred head of cattle in three days. 
 His agricultural pursuits had not only ceased to interest him but had become repulsive, and he could no longer give his mind to them. Added to this there was Kitty Shcherbatskaya not more than twenty miles away, and he wanted to meet her, yet could not. 
 When he called on Dolly, she had asked him to come again and come with the object of once more proposing to her sister, letting him feel that her sister would now accept him. Levin himself having seen Kitty Shcherbatskaya knew that he had not ceased to love her, yet he could not go to the Oblonskys' house while she was there. 
 That he had proposed and she had refused him had put an impossible barrier between them. 'I cannot ask her to be my wife just because she cannot be the wife of the man she wanted,' he said to himself, and this thought rendered him cold and hostile toward her. 
 'I shall not have the strength to speak to her without reproach or to look at her without ill will, and she will only hate me all the more – as it is only right she should. Besides, how can I go there now after what Darya Alexandrovna told me? 
 And I should come magnanimously to forgive her, to show mercy to her! I – stand before her in the role of one who forgives her and honours her with his love! 
 Dolly sent to him to ask for a side-saddle for Kitty. 'I have been told,' she wrote, 'that you have a side-saddle. 
 The bald-headed, fresh-faced old man, with a red beard which was growing grey round the cheeks, opened the gates and pressed close to the post to let the three-horsed vehicle enter. 
 After showing the coachman to a place in a lean-to, in a large, clean, tidy, newly-constructed yard where stood some charred wooden ploughs, the old man invited Levin to enter the house. 
 After pointing to the door with her bare arm she again stooped, hiding her handsome face, and went on scrubbing. 
 The good-looking woman in goloshes, with two empty pails swinging from a wooden yoke, ran down before him to fetch water from the well. 
 He too stops at our place,' he began garrulously, leaning on the banisters of the porch. 
 In the midst of his conversation about his acquaintanceship with Sviyazhsky the gates creaked again, and the labourers returning from the fields came into the yard with their ploughs and harrows. 
 The old master of the house left the porch and went to unharness the horses. 
 Don't let the gelding out, Fedot, lead him to the trough. We'll harness another.' 
 Other women, young and handsome, middle-aged, old and plain, some with children, others without, appeared from somewhere. 
 He had planted many potatoes which had already flowered and were forming fruit, as Levin had noticed when passing the fields on the way, while Levin's own potatoes were just beginning to flower. 
 The vigorous young son with his mouth full of buckwheat porridge was saying something funny, and everybody laughed heartily – the woman with the goloshes laughing more merrily than anyone as she refilled the bowl with cabbage soup. 
 He knew that both Sviyazhsky and his wife wanted to see her married to him, Levin. 
 Besides, at the bottom of his heart he wanted to put himself to the test and again to estimate his feelings for the girl. 
 Sviyazhsky's home life was extremely pleasant, and Sviyazhsky himself was the best type of social worker that Levin had ever known, and Levin always found him very interesting. 
 Levin tried but could not understand him, and regarded him and his life as animated riddles. 
 The hostess was a short, fair, round-faced woman, beaming with smiles and dimples. 
 'You yourself teach?' asked Levin, trying to look beyond the bodice, but conscious that if he looked in her direction he must see it. 
 He looked with his glittering black eyes straight at an excited landowner, with a grey moustache, whose words evidently amused him. 
 You would hardly believe what drunkenness and debauchery there is! 
 At the works now they took money in advance, and went off. 
 If it were not for that, one had better give up everything and flee to the ends of the earth.' 
 'Yes, Michael Petrovich gets on, but ask him how? 
 'My farming is very simple, thank heaven!' said Michael Petrovich. 'My farming is to have money ready for the autumn taxes. 
 They'll water the horses at the wrong time, tear good harness, change a wheel with an iron tire for one without, or drop a bolt into the threshing machine in order to break it. 
 But it did not interest Levin, and, as soon as the landlord had finished, Levin returned to the first proposition, and, trying to get Sviyazhsky to express his views seriously, said to him: 
 They will break your inferior Russian threshers, but they cannot break my steam threshing-machine. 
 It is all very well for you, but I have a son at the university to keep, and to pay for the little ones' education at the secondary school, so that I cannot buy Flemish drays.' 
 I at any rate never spent money on improvements without loss. Expensive cattle bring me a loss, and machinery too.' 
 'Then we are outside that law: rent does not explain anything in our case, but on the contrary only causes confusion. 
 I am, of course, not a professor of Sociology, but it interests me, and really if it interests you, you had better study the matter.' 
 The landowners had risen, and Sviyazhsky, having again checked Levin in his disagreeable habit of prying beyond the reception rooms of his mind, went to see his visitors off. 
 And why, why does the Partition of Poland interest him?' And when Sviyazhsky had finished he could not help asking him, 'Well, and what of it?' 
 'Yes, but I marshal them in the opposite direction,' said Sviyazhsky, laughing. 
 In Europe rational farming answers because the people are educated; therefore we must educate our people – that's all.' 
 "Well, then, you had better pray to God." – "I have, and that made me worse!" It is just the same with us. 
 'Now that I never could understand,' replied Levin, hotly. 'How will schools help the peasants to improve their material conditions? 
 And in what way knowing how to add and subtract and to say the catechism will help them to improve their material condition, I never could understand! The other evening I met a woman with an infant in her arms and asked her where she was going. 
 She replied that she had been to see the "wise woman" because her boy was fractious, and she took him to be cured. 
 Education will stop them from carrying their children to the roosts to cure them of fractiousness,' said Sviyazhsky with a merry smile. 
 Levin saw that he would not succeed in finding a connection between this man's life and his thoughts. 
 That he disliked and evaded by turning the conversation to something pleasantly jocular. 
 Not one of the talks he had had with Sviyazhsky, though much that was clever had been said by the latter, interested him, but the landowner's arguments required consideration. 
 Your and our common dissatisfaction with farming shows that we, and not the peasants, are at fault. 
 Divide equally and give half the produce to labour, and the share left for you will be larger, and the labour force will receive more. 
 How this can be done is a question of details, but it is certainly possible."-' 
 He had not meant to leave next day, but now decided to go away early in the morning. 
 And they themselves, when they talked, said much, but never said what they really wanted. 
 The naive Ivan, who, it seemed to Levin, best understood the plan, formed an artel [An artel is a workman's profit-sharing association, with mutual responsibility, common in Russia.] consisting chiefly of his own family, and became partner in the dairy section. 
 An old inn-keeper, into whose house he had gone to dry himself, evidently approved of Levin's plan and had offered to join a group to buy cattle. 
 'I need only push on steadily toward my aim and I shall achieve it,' he thought, 'and it is worth working and striving for. 
 The whole system of farming, and above all the position of the people, must be completely altered: instead of poverty – wealth and satisfaction for all; instead of hostility – concord and a bond of common interest. 
 Having dined, Levin as usual sat down in his easy-chair with a book, and while reading continued to think about his impending journey in connection with the book he was writing. To-day the importance of his work presented itself to him with especial clearness, and whole paragraphs of their own accord shaped themselves in his mind, expressing the gist of his thoughts. 
 Having written for some time, Levin suddenly with particular vividness remembered Kitty, her refusal, and their last meeting. 
 'What is the use of fretting?' said Agatha Mikhaylovna. 'Why do you always sit at home? 
 'But, whatever you do, an idler will always bungle. 
 'I only say,' answered Agatha Mikhaylovna, evidently not speaking at random but with strict sequence of thought, 'you must marry, that is all!' 
 He frowned, and without replying again sat down to his work, repeating to himself all that he had been thinking about its importance. 
 Only occasionally, in the stillness, he listened to the clicking of her needles and, remembering what he did not wish to remember, made a wry face. 
 'There now! Visitors have come to you,' said Agatha Mikhaylovna, rising and going toward the door. 
 Under the sway of the thoughts that had come to him and of Agatha Mikhaylovna's reminders, he was in an unsettled and confused state of mind and the forthcoming meeting with his brother seemed particularly distressing. 
 Angry with himself for this bad feeling Levin ran into the hall; and as soon as he had a near view of his brother this feeling of disappointment vanished and was replaced by pity. 
 He stood in the hall jerking his long, thin neck, drawing a scarf from it, and smiling in a strangely piteous manner. When he saw this meek, submissive smile, Levin felt his throat contract convulsively. 
 Health is the great thing, and my health, thank God, has improved.' 
 Levin listened, trying but unable to think of what to say. 
 But neither of them dared speak of it, and not having expressed the one thing that occupied their thoughts, whatever they said rang false. 
 The house being damp, and only his bedroom heated, Levin put his brother to sleep behind a partition in that room. 
 Nicholas went to bed but, whether he slept or not, kept tossing and coughing like a sick man and, when unable to clear his throat, muttering some complaint. 
 Sometimes he sighed deeply and said, 'Oh, my God!' Sometimes, when the phlegm choked him, he muttered angrily, 'Oh, the devil!' 
 But what that inevitable Death was, he not only did not know, not only had never considered, but could not and dared not consider. 
 He sat on his bed in the dark, doubled his arms round his knees and thought, scarcely breathing from the mental strain. 
 Just when the question of how to live had become a little clearer to him, a new insoluble problem presented itself – Death. 
 LEVIN HAD LONG AGO NOTICED that after people have made one uncomfortable by their pliancy and submissiveness they soon become unbearably exacting and aggressive. 
 'That idea,' said Nicholas Levin with a sarcastic smile and angrily glistening eyes, 'that idea at any rate, if one may say so, has a geometric charm of definiteness and certainty. 
 It may be utopian; but granting the possibility of making a tabula rasa of the past – and abolishing private property and families – then labour comes by its own. 
 'But I have been, and now I think it is premature but reasonable, and that it has a future as Christianity had in the first centuries.' 
 'I want to establish...' 
 You simply want to be original, as you always have done, and to show that you are not just exploiting the peasants, but have ideas!' 
 He again kissed his brother, but he did not know what to answer. 
 He saw death and the approach of death in everything; but the work he had begun interested him all the more. 
 She had not the least idea what would settle it, but was quite certain that it would now come very soon. 
 Vronsky had a distinguished appearance, possessed the art of carrying himself with respectful dignity, and was in the habit of associating with people of that class. 
 That was why he was chosen to attend the Prince; but the task seemed a hard one to him. 
 And the Prince imbibed the Russian spirit with the greatest ease, smashed trays full of crockery, made gipsy girls sit on his lap, and yet seemed to be always asking: 'What next? 
 But the chief reason why the Prince's presence oppressed Vronsky was that he saw himself reflected in the Prince, and what he saw in that mirror was not flattering to his vanity. 
 Vronsky was the same, and considered it very meritorious to be so, but in his relations with the Prince he was the inferior and felt indignant with that condescendingly good-natured treatment. 
 'She was coming to me,' thought Vronsky; 'that would have been better. 
 Vronsky, though not in the habit of noticing details, noticed the look of surprise on the man's face. 
 'No!' she cried when she saw him, and at the first sound of her voice tears filled her eyes. 'No! 
 She scrutinized his face to make up for the time she had not seen him. 
 'YOU MET HIM?' she asked when they sat down at a table under the lamp. 'That is your punishment for being late.' 
 But never mind: don't speak about it. 
 He wished to say that he had been up all night and had fallen asleep, but seeing her excited and happy face he felt ashamed. 
 Is it not the kind of life all you young men lead?' she said, frowning; and taking up her crochet-work from the table began disentangling the hook without looking at Vronsky. 
 'Lisa called on me this morning; they still visit me in spite of the Countess Lydia Ivanovna,' she said, 'and she told me about your Athenian party. 
 'Well, what were you going to tell me about the Prince? I have driven away the demon,' she added. 
 They spoke of jealousy as 'the demon.' 'Yes, what had you begun telling me about the Prince? 
 'Oh, it was intolerable!' he said, trying to pick up the lost thread of what he had in his mind. 'He does not improve on nearer acquaintance. 
 If I am to describe him, he is a finely-bred animal, like those that get prizes at cattle-shows, and nothing more,' he concluded in a tone of vexation which awoke her interest. 
 One can see that he has been educated only to have the right to despise education, as they despise everything except animal pleasures.' 
 'I don't take his part, and it is a matter of complete indifference to me, but I should say that as you did not like these pleasures you might have declined to go. 
 'I can't at all understand him,' said Vronsky. 'Had he after your explanation in the country broken with you, had he challenged me, yes! 
 But this sort of thing I do not understand. How can he put up with such a position? 
 'But not he! 
 Could a man who has any feelings live in the same house with his guilty wife? 
 What is that illness of yours? What does the doctor say?' 
 Don't interrupt,' she said hurriedly. 
 'That is right, that is better,' she said, firmly pressing his hand. 'This is all, all that remains to us.' 
 He recovered and lifted his head. 
 'A dream?' Vronsky instantly remembered the peasant of his dream. 
 And Vronsky, remembering his dream, felt the same horror filling his soul. 
 And in my horror I tried to wake, but I woke still in a dream and began asking myself what it could mean, and Korney says to me: "You will die in childbed, in childbed, ma'am..." 
 I must speak to you,' he said, taking the letter-case under his arm and pressing it so tight with his elbow that his shoulder went up. 
 He too was silent for a while and then again began in a less squeaky voice, coldly emphasizing certain chance words that had no special importance. 
 'I came to tell you...' said he. 
 'Alexis Alexandrovich! Leave me Serezha!' she whispered again. 
 Karenin flushed, and pulling away his hand left the room. 
 'The lawyer is engaged,' replied the assistant sternly, and indicated with his pen the persons who were waiting. 
 His whole life had been spent in administrative activity, and therefore when he disapproved of anything his disapproval was mitigated by a recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of improvement in everything. 
 The lawyer looked down at Karenin's feet, feeling that the sight of his irrepressible joy might offend his client. 
 And on Karenin's nodding affirmatively the lawyer continued, only occasionally casting a glance at Karenin's face, which had grown red in patches. 
 'Divorce, under our laws,' he said, with a slight shade of disapproval of the laws, 'as you are aware, may be granted in the following cases... You must wait!' he exclaimed, addressing his assistant who had looked in at the door; but he rose all the same, spoke a few words to his assistant, and sat down again. 
 As all his fingers had been used he straightened them all out and continued: 'That is the theoretical view; but I suppose you have done me the honour of applying to me in order to learn the practical application of the law. Therefore, guided by the precedents, I have to inform you that cases of divorce all come to the following: – there is, I suppose, no physical defect or absence without news?...' 
 'Yes, you were saying...' he began 
 After a short pause he said, 'I may conclude from your words that a divorce could be obtained. 
 The new committee for investigating the conditions of the subject-races from every point of view had been formed and sent to its field of action with unusual promptitude and energy, stirred up by Karenin. 
 But Stremov, who had been touched to the quick at the last meeting, made use of tactics for which Karenin was not prepared. 
 These measures, going beyond Karenin's original idea, were accepted, and then Stremov's tactics became manifest. 
 Stremov stood aside, pretending to have blindly followed Karenin's plans and to be himself indignant now at what had been done, thus undermining Karenin. 
 He announced, to the surprise of the Committee, that he would ask to be allowed to go and investigate the matter himself, and having received permission he started for the distant Provinces. 
 He raised his hat and was going on, but Oblonsky told the coachman to stop and ran across the snow. 
 I am so glad to see you!' and he kicked his feet together to knock off the snow. 'What a shame not to send word!' 
 Very pleased to see you,' he said in a tone that expressed clearly that he was very sorry. 'How are you?' 
 'She is well,' replied Karenin, frowning. 'I shall be very pleased,' and he went back to his carriage. 
 'Queer chap!' said Oblonsky to his wife, and after glancing at his watch waved his hand in front of his face as a sign of endearment to his wife and children, and walked jauntily away along the pavement. 
 Oblonsky liked a good dinner, but liked still more giving a dinner-party: not a big affair, but one select in food, drink, and guests. 
 With the programme for that day's dinner he was very satisfied; there would be perch (brought alive to the kitchen) and asparagus, the piece le resistance was to consist of a splendid but quite plain joint of roast beef, and the wines would be well chosen: so much for the food and drink. 
 As for the guests, there would be Kitty and Levin, and, in order that they should not be too conspicuous, a girl cousin and young Shcherbatsky – here the pièce de résistance was to consist of Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev and Alexis Alexandrovich Karenin: Sergius Ivanich, a Muscovite and a philosopher, and Alexis Alexandrovich, a Petersburger and a practical politician. 
 The second instalment of the forest money had been paid and was not yet all spent. Dolly had been very nice and kind of late, and the thought of his dinner-party pleased Oblonsky in every respect. 
 This superior also had the reputation of having the manners of a bear, and he was reported to hold views diametrically opposed to those of his predecessor and, till now, of Oblonsky also. 
 'After all, they're all human beings, all men, just like us poor sinners,' he thought, as he entered the hotel. 'What is there to be angry and quarrel about?' 
 Walking down the corridor with his hat tilted on one side, he said, 'How do you do, Vassily?' to a servant he knew. 
 Levin – number seven, eh? 
 'Do take your things off and stay,' said Levin, removing the hat. 
 Later on he took it off and stayed for an hour, talking to Levin about bear-hunting and also about personal matters. 
 I never stop thinking of death,' said Levin. 'It really is time for me to die. 
 All those things are mere nonsense. I will tell you frankly: I value my idea and my work immensely, but really... 
 Just think! This whole world of ours is only a speck of mildew sprung up on a tiny planet; yet we think we can have something great – thoughts, actions! 
 So now you have come round to my notion. Do you remember how you used to fly at me for seeking enjoyment in life? 
 'But of course the good in life is...' Levin became confused. 
 'Oh, I don't know. All I know is, that we shall all die soon.' 
 'Don't go yet!' said Levin, trying to detain him. 'When shall we meet again? 
 He had heard that she went to Petersburg at the beginning of the winter to visit her sister, who had married a diplomatist. 
 The members of the deputation had not the least comprehension of their role or of their duties. 
 Karenin had a prolonged tussle with them, and wrote out for them a programme which they were not to overstep, and having dismissed them he wrote two letters to Petersburg. 
 In this matter his chief helper was the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, who was a specialist in deputations. 
 'No matter!' thought Karenin, 'it is even better so. I will tell him about my position with regard to his sister at once, and will explain why I cannot dine at his house.' 
 What do you mean?' he demanded in French, quite taken aback. 
 But before Karenin could finish what he was about to say, Oblonsky did something quite unexpected. 
 'Forgive me, but I can't – I can't believe it...' 
 'But it is awful!' said Oblonsky, sighing deeply. 'One thing I would do, Alexis Alexandrovich, if I were you – I entreat you to do it! 
 You have not yet commenced proceedings, as I understand? 
 The reason I did not call on you is that I think our relationship must be altered.' 
 'But why won't you come? 
 'I really don't know what his tendencies are, but I do know that he is a first-rate fellow,' replied Oblonsky. 'I have just been to see him, and he really is a first-rate chap. 
 Oblonsky noticed at once that, without him, things were going badly in the drawing-room. 
 Having patted Turovtsyn on the shoulder, he whispered something funny in his ear and got him to sit down next to Dolly and the old Prince. 
 Then he told Kitty that she was looking very nice, and introduced young Shcherbatsky to Karenin. 
 But at that moment Constantine Levin was not in a state fully to appreciate the pleasure of such an acquaintance. 
 'You were driving to Ergushevo,' said Levin, feeling that the happiness with which his heart was overflowing was taking his breath away. 'How did I dare to connect anything that was not innocent with this pathetic being! 
 If you please,' said Oblonsky, motioning them toward the dining-room. 
 Karenin was arguing that the Russification of Poland could only be accomplished by high principles which the Russian Administration must introduce. 
 Koznyshev agreed with both, but with limitations. 
 'Consequently for the Russification of the alien nationalities, there is but one means: to breed as many children as possible... 
 So my brother and I are acting worst of all, and you married gentlemen, and especially Stephen Arkadyevich, are acting most patriotically. 
 'Yes, that is the very best way,' he said, chewing some cheese and filling the glass with a special kind of vodka. And the conversation was really ended by the joke. 
 'Have you really been doing gymnastics again?' he went on turning to Levin, and with his left hand he felt Levin's muscles. 
 'I expect great strength is needed for bear-hunting,' said Karenin, who had the vaguest notions about sport, as he helped himself to cheese and broke his slice of bread, cut as fine as a cobweb. 
 Quite casually, without looking at them and just as if there was no other place to put them, Oblonsky placed Levin and Kitty side by side. 
 PESTSOV LIKED TO BRING HIS DISCUSSIONS TO A FINISH, and had not been satisfied with Koznyshev's remark, especially as he felt the fallacy of his own opinion. 
 In my opinion only that nation which is more highly developed can influence another, only that...' 
 Which will nationalize the other? 
 'I have had a classical education, but can personally find no place in that controversy. I see no clear proofs that a classical education should be preferred to a modern education.' 
 'Natural science has just as great an educational and mind-developing influence,' Pestsov joined in. 'Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of general laws!' 
 Besides it is impossible to deny that the influence of the classics is in the highest degree a moral one, whereas unfortunately with instruction in natural science are connected those dangerous and false teachings which are the bane of the present times.' 
 Koznyshev quietly waited to put in his word, evidently ready with triumphant retort. 
 Everybody laughed at Koznyshev's 'pills,' and Turovtsyn, who had at last heard the something funny for which he had been waiting as he listened to the conversation, laughed particularly loudly and merrily. 
 'The Government is evidently guided by general considerations and is indifferent to the influence its measures may have. 
 For instance, it ought to consider the education of women injurious, yet it established courses of lectures and universities for women.' 
 'But if women, in some rare exceptional cases, can fill these posts, it seems to me that you should not speak of " rights." 
 So it would be more correct to say that women are seeking for duties, and quite rightly. 
 'In all probability they will be extremely capable,' interjected Oblonsky, 'when education is more widely diffused among them. 
 'Oh yes, an Englishman on board ship did once nurse his baby,' said the old Prince, allowing himself this indelicacy in his daughters' presence. 
 'Yes, but what is a girl to do if she has no home?' said Oblonsky, agreeing with Pestsov and supporting him, and thinking of the dancer Chibisova, whom he had in his mind all the time. 
 'And I am hampered and oppressed by the knowledge that they won't take me as a wet-nurse in the Foundlings' Hospital,' repeated the old Prince, to the great joy of Turovtsyn, who laughed till he dropped the thick end of a piece of asparagus into the sauce. 
 He has a heart of gold.' 
 Levin looked at Turovtsyn again and wondered how it was he had failed to realize what a charming man he was. 
 Oblonsky hurriedly offered Karenin a cigar. 
 'I imagine that the cause of the prevailing opinion lies in the very nature of things,' he said, and was about to go to the drawing-room, but Turovtsyn quite unexpectedly addressed him. 
 'Have you heard about Pryachnikov?' said Turovtsyn, animated by the champagne he had drunk, and impatient to break his silence, which had long oppressed him. 
 As one always seems to knock a sore place, so that day Oblonsky felt that unfortunately the conversation kept striking Karenin's sore place. 
 'Oh!' said Karenin indifferently, and raising his eyebrows he went to the drawing-room. 
 'I am so glad you came,' said Dolly with a frightened smile, as she met him in the sitting-room through which he had to pass: 'I must speak with you. 
 Dolly was firmly convinced of Anna's innocence, and felt herself growing pale and her lips trembling from anger with this cold, unfeeling man who so calmly intended to ruin her innocent friend. 
 'I don't, I don't believe it, I cannot believe it!' Dolly said, clasping her bony hands with an energetic movement. 
 'I don't believe it, I don't!' she uttered, trying to catch his eyes, which avoided hers. 
 'One can't disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna,' said he, emphasizing the word fact. 
 'Darya Alexandrovna,' he said, now looking straight at Dolly's kind, excited face and feeling his tongue involuntarily loosened. 'I would give much for the possibility of doubting. 
 She was silent, thinking of herself and her own sorrow, and then suddenly and energetically she raised her head and folded her hands as in prayer. 
 'What can I do?' said Karenin, shrugging his shoulders and raising his eyebrows. 
 He gave himself a shake and began to speak in a loud and piercing voice. 
 He began at once, and without the slightest effort, to fulfil the promise he had made her, of thinking well of and always liking everybody. 
 But he talked to them only with the idea of getting them to agree and softening their controversy. 
 He was not at all interested in what he himself said, still less in what they were saying, and only desired one thing – that everybody should feel contented and pleased. 
 'No, we were only coming to call you away. Thank you for coming,' she said, rewarding him with a smile as with a gift. 
 But as soon as he began to explain she understood. 
 Levin agreed with Dolly, that a girl who does not get married can find woman's work in the family. 
 'No,' said Kitty, blushing, but looking all the more boldly at him with her truthful eyes: 'A girl may be so placed that she cannot enter into a family without humiliation, while she herself...' 
 He seized the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, broke it, and wrote the initial letters of the following: 'I have nothing to forget or forgive, I never ceased to love you.' 
 But before he had finished writing she read it under his hand, finished the sentence herself, and wrote the answer: 'Yes.' 
 Oblonsky's look and smile showed Levin that he understood him rightly. 
 'Then it's not time to die yet?' asked Oblonsky with feeling, pressing Levin's hand. 
 Dolly too, when saying good-bye to him, spoke as if congratulating him, saying: 'I am so glad you and Kitty have met again. We must value old friendship.' 
 Levin did not like her remark. She did not understand how high and unattainable for her all this was, and she should not have dared to refer to it. 
 Nothing, nothing, silence...' said Levin, and again wrapping the collar round his brother's face he added: 'I am very fond of you! 
 The attendant on duty lighted his candle and was going away, but Levin stopped him. 
 It is easier in a gentleman's house, but one earns more here.' 
 Levin took this opportunity to express to Egor his opinion that in marriage the chief thing is – love, and that when there is love there will always be happiness because happiness lies always within oneself. 
 He opened the little window [The fortochka, or small inset window customary in Russia, which allows of fresh air being let into the room in winter without cooling it too much.] and sat down on a table in front of it. 
 He passed dejectedly, frowning and coughing. 'Poor, unfortunate fellow!' thought Levin, and tears of affection and pity for the man filled his eyes. 
 It was past nine when he reached the Shcherbatskys' porch a second time. 
 All that night and morning Levin had lived quite unconsciously, and felt quite outside the conditions of material existence. 
 He spent the rest of the time walking about the streets, looking at his watch, and gazing around. 
 And what he then saw he never saw again. 
 Two children going to school, some pigeons that flew down from the roof, and a few loaves put outside a baker's window by an invisible hand touched him particularly. 
 In the next room they were saying something about machines and fraud, and coughing as people do of a morning. 
 Trying not to offend the others, and promising to let them too drive him later on he hired one and told him to drive to the Shcherbatskys'. 
 Glancing into his kind old eyes, Levin felt something new even in his happiness. 
 She had prepared herself to meet him alone, and had rejoiced at the idea, yet had felt timid and bashful and had not known what she would do. 
 Without thinking or asking herself what next, she had come to him and acted as she had. 
 She smiled at the word 'dear,' and at the timid look he gave her. 'Yes!' she said significantly and slowly. 
 Kitty stood close to her father's chair, still holding his hand. 
 The Princess went up to her husband, kissed him and was about to go away, but he stopped her, embraced her, and tenderly, like a young lover, kissed her several times, with a smile. 
 When they had gone Levin came up to his betrothed and took her hand. 
 I never dared hope, yet in my soul I was always certain,' said he. 'I believe it was predestined.' 
 It was painful but he thought he ought to tell her both these things. 
 She was religious and had never doubted the truth of her religion, but the lack of external religion in him did not affect her at all. 
 'Take, take those dreadful books back!' she cried, pushing away the note-books that lay on the table before her. 'Why did you give me them?... 
 The man replied that the valet had just gone out. 
 The first contained the news that Stremov had obtained the very appointment Karenin had been hoping for. He threw down the telegram and flushed. 
 Rising, he began to pace the room. 'Quos vult perdere dementat,' he thought, quos being those who had had a hand in making the appointment. 
 It was from his wife, and Anna, written in blue pencil, was the first word he saw. 'I am dying. 
 'She would not hesitate at any deception. She was going to be confined; perhaps that is the illness. 
 To legitimize the child, compromise me, and prevent a divorce?' he reflected. 'But there is something about dying...' 
 He re-read the telegram, and was suddenly struck by the direct meaning of the words. 
 The carriage stopped at the porch. 
 A carriage, with a coachman asleep on the box, and an izvoshchik were standing at the entrance. 
 'If it is all a fraud, then calm contempt and leave again; if true, keep up appearances.' 
 The door was opened by the hall-porter before Karenin had time to ring. The porter, Petrov, otherwise Kapitonich, looked strange in an old coat without a tie, and in slippers. 
 'Take my things,' said Karenin; and somewhat relieved by the news that there was still some hope of her dying, he entered the ante-room. 
 She approached Karenin, and with a familiarity bred by death's approach took him by the hand and led him toward the bedroom. 
 'Oh, what nonsense!' Anna went on, taking no notice of her husband. 
 'But let me have her, let me have my little girl! 
 Wait, wait!...' she paused as if to collect her thoughts. 
 That other is not I. Now I am the real one, all of me. 
 I am dreadfully bad, but the nurse told about the holy martyr – what was her name? – she was worse. 
 You are too good!' With one hot hand she held his, while with the other she pushed him away. 
 The doctor moved her arms and carefully drew the bedclothes over her shoulders. 
 'Uncover, yes, uncover your face!' she went on angrily. 'Alexis Alexandrovich, uncover his face! 
 Karenin held out his hand, without restraining the tears that were falling. 
 How badly those flowers are drawn, not a bit like violets,' and she pointed to the wallpaper. 
 Vronsky went away, but came again in the morning to inquire. Karenin met him in the ante-room and said: 'Remain here: she may ask for you,' and himself showed him into Anna's boudoir. 
 I must explain to you my feelings, those that have guided me and will guide me in future, so that you may not misunderstand me. 
 He stopped and reflected whether he should reveal his feelings or not. 'But I saw her and forgave her. 
 I only pray God that the joy of forgiving may not be taken from me.' Tears filled his eyes, and their clear calm expression struck Vronsky. 
 'My duty is clearly defined: I must and will remain with her. 
 He rose, and sobs broke his voice. Vronsky got up at once, and stooping before him looked up into his face without unbending his back. 
 AFTER HIS CONVERSATION with Karenin Vronsky went out on to the Karenins' porch and then stopped, recalling with difficulty where he was and where he ought to go. 
 All the apparently solid habits and rules of his life suddenly seemed false and inapplicable. 
 He was unspeakably miserable because his passion for Anna, which he imagined had of late begun to cool, had become even stronger now that he knew her to be lost to him for ever. 
 And just now, when he knew her and loved her in the right way, he had been humiliated before her and had lost her for ever, leaving her nothing but a shameful memory of himself. 
 Returning home after the three sleepless nights, Vronsky did not undress but lay down prone on a sofa, with his head on his folded arms. 
 The waves of the sea of unconscious life were beginning to close over his head when all at once he felt as if he had received a violent electric shock. 
 This reiteration prevented other images and memories which were thronging his brain from arising. 
 Again, following each other with great rapidity, his happiest moments rose in his fancy; and with them his recent humiliation. 'Take away his hands,' Anna's voice is saying. 
 He listened and heard repeated in a strange mad whisper the words, 'Unable to value, unable to enjoy; unable to value, unable to enjoy.' 
 'What is this? Am I going mad?' he asked himself. 
 'No, I must sleep!' He moved the cushion and pressed his head against it, but his eyes would not remain closed without effort. 
 His thoughts glided quickly over his life unconnected with his passion for Anna. 
 He made an effort and understood that he was on the floor, and, seeing blood on the tiger-skin and on his hand, realized that he had tried to shoot himself. 
 He forgave Vronsky and pitied him, especially when reports of Vronsky's desperate action reached him. 
 Several times a day he went to the nursery, and remained there so long that the nurses, who had been shy in his presence, became quite used to him. 
 When the softened mood caused by the nearness of death had passed, Karenin began to notice that Anna feared him, was oppressed by his presence, and avoided looking him straight in the eyes. 
 It was as if she wished, yet could not make up her mind, to say something, and foreseeing that their present relation could not continue, expected something from him too. 
 Toward four o'clock, having finished his work, he returned home. 
 All through that difficult time Karenin noticed that all his worldly acquaintances, especially the women, displayed a particularly lively interest in him and his wife. 
 The presence of Princess Tverskaya and the memories associated with her, coupled with the fact that he had never liked her, was unpleasant to Karenin, and he went straight to the nursery. 
 An English nursery governess, who since Anna's illness had replaced the French governess with the boy, sat doing some crochet-work. She hurriedly rose, curtseyed, and nudged Serezha. 
 Karenin passed his hand over his son's hair, answered the governess's inquiry about Anna's health, and asked what the doctor had said about baby. 
 Karenin reflected a moment and then entered the other room. 
 The old nurse with a gesture of vexation came up and took her from the wet-nurse, and began pacing up and down, rocking the baby in her arms. 
 When the child was pacified and laid in her deep cot, and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow went away, Karenin rose, and stepping with difficulty on tiptoe approached the infant. 
 Karenin, with a frightened and guilty face, stopped short and thought of returning unnoticed; but coming to the conclusion that this would be undignified he turned, coughed, and went toward the bedroom door. 
 I have not seen you since Anna's illness. 
 'But your face looks feverish,' said he, emphasizing the word feverish. 
 I can't receive him, and it would lead...' She stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband, who was not looking at her. 
 Her first impulse was to draw away her hand from his moist one with the thick swelling veins, that was seeking hers; but with evident effort she pressed it. 
 [In Russian as in French and other languages the second person singular is used in conversation between intimates and also in speaking to inferiors.] 'And I am very grateful for your decision. 
 'Then why would you not let me nurse her, when I entreated you to? She is a child anyhow' (he understood what she meant by that anyhow) 'and they will kill her.' 
 'Yes, you are blaming me! Oh God, why did I not die?' and she began to sob. 
 'Wait a little, Princess, before putting on your glove! Let me kiss your hand! 
 'Oh, I am very glad!' said Betsy, at once understanding that he referred to Anna. She returned to the dining-room with him and they stood together in a corner. 
 'He will kill her,' said Betsy in a significant whisper. 'This is impossible, impossible...' 
 Again he smiled his almond-oil smile. 'I will begin at the beginning: you married a man twenty years older than yourself. 
 Your husband has accepted that and forgiven you.' He paused between each sentence, expecting her to make objections; but she made no answer. 
 'Never mind, we'll spread out something to catch you. 
 How happy I should be if I could arrange it,' continued Oblonsky, now smiling more boldly. 'Don't, don't say a word! 
 OBLONSKY, WITH THE SAME RATHER SOLEMN EXPRESSION with which he was wont to take the chair at Council meetings, entered Karenin's study. 
 To hide that embarrassment he took out a cigarette-case with a new kind of fastening which he had only just bought, smelt the leather of which it was made, and took out a cigarette. 
 I must have... I must have a talk with you,' said Oblonsky, surprised at his own unaccustomed timidity. 
 That timidity was so unexpected and strange that Oblonsky could not believe it was his conscience telling him that what he was about to do was wrong. 
 Karenin stopped. He made no reply, but the expression of submissive self-sacrifice on his face struck Oblonsky. 
 'I intended to talk to you about my sister and your mutual position,' said Oblonsky, still struggling with his unwonted timidity. 
 'Yes, yes!' said Oblonsky, tears choking him and preventing his reply. 
 'I am afraid she does not understand her position herself. She is no judge of it,' replied Oblonsky, growing more composed. 
 'She is crushed, literally crushed by your generosity. If she reads this letter she will not have the strength to say anything – she will only hang her head lower than ever.' 
 'But how?' he added, moving his hands before his eyes in a manner unusual with him. 'I don't see any possible way out.' 
 Yes, divorce,' Oblonsky answered, reddening. 'That would be the most reasonable way, from every point of view, with a couple placed as you are. 
 What is to be done if they find out that life together has become impossible, as might happen anywhere?' 
 Karenin sighed heavily and closed his eyes. 'There is only one thing to consider: does either party wish to remarry? 
 If not, it is very simple,' went on Oblonsky, gradually overcoming his embarrassment. 
 But besides all this, what made divorce seem to Karenin more impossible than any other course was that by consenting to it he would by that very act ruin Anna. 
 What Dolly had said in Moscow, to the effect that in considering a divorce he was thinking of himself and not of Anna, who would then be irretrievably lost, had sunk into his heart. And having connected these words with his forgiveness and with his attachment to the children, he now understood them in his own way. 
 To agree to a divorce – to give her her freedom – would mean, as he looked at it, to deprive himself of the only thing that bound him to life, the children he loved, and to deprive her of the last support on the path of virtue and cast her to perdition. 
 'But evidently it was God's will,' he added, and having said it felt how silly it was and could hardly help smiling at his own stupidity. 
 Answer: 'A chemist makes solutions which do not make anyone happy, but I have made a dissolution and made three people happy!' Or, 'Why am I like a chemist?... 
 When he was first able to talk again his brother's wife Varya was alone with him. 
 Now he could think quietly about Karenin, fully realizing his generosity without being humiliated thereby. 
 Besides that, he got into his old rut again. 
 Serpukhovskoy thought out a post for him in Tashkend and Vronsky accepted the proposition without the least hesitation. 
 Without seeing anyone or anything he ran up the stairs and entered her room with hurried steps – almost at a run. 
 Without thinking, or considering whether they were alone or not, he embraced her and covered her face, hands, and neck with kisses. 
 If our love could be stronger, there being something terrible in it would make it so,' he said, raising his head with a smile that showed his fine teeth. 
 She could not help smiling in answer, not to his words but to his enamoured eyes. 
 'Is it possible that we shall be like husband and wife, alone, a family, you and I?' she said, looking closely into his eyes. 
 'Don't talk and don't think about it' he said, playing with her hand and trying to draw her attention to himself; but she continued to gaze past him. 
 'Oh, why did I not die? It would have been best!' she said, the tears streaming noiselessly down her cheeks; but unwilling to pain him, she tried to smile. 
 He had not even any plans or aims for the future, but left these to others to decide, quite sure that everything would turn out splendidly. 
 His brother Sergius Ivanich, Oblonsky, and the Princess directed his actions. He quite agreed to every proposal. 
 'You are a good one!' remarked Oblonsky, laughing. 
 But it won't do, you know; you must confess and receive the sacrament.' 
 In his present state of mind, softened and sensitive to everything, to be obliged to pretend was not only trying but appeared impossible. 
 He felt unable to do either. 
 He then tried to regard it all as a meaningless, empty custom, like making a round of calls, but felt equally unable to do that. 
 He could not believe in it, and yet was not firmly convinced that it was all false. 
 He stood through the mass and vespers and evensong, and the next day, having got up earlier than usual, he went to church before breakfast to hear morning prayers and to confess. 
 As was nearly always the case just then, they had nothing to say to each other, and she had put her hand on the table and kept opening and closing it until she herself began to laugh at its motions. He remembered how he had kissed the hand and afterwards examined the converging lines on the rosy palm. 
 There he is, bowing down to the ground. That always happens just before the end.' 
 At the end he bowed to the ground and turned to Levin. 
 The priest paused a few seconds to see whether Levin would say anything more, and then closing his eyes said rapidly, with a strong provincial accent: 
 The devil is very powerful and we must resist him. 
 'Yes,' answered Levin, with a blush for the priest. 'Why need he ask me that at confession?' he thought. 
 You cannot help knowing, since God in His great mercy has revealed it to you. 
 There are hosts of aspirants who aim at mixing those two professions but I am not one of them!' 
 'There you are!' said Sergius Ivanich. 'Good-bye to bear-hunting in future! 
 The idea that his wife would not allow it seemed so agreeable that he was prepared to forgo the pleasure of ever setting eyes on a bear again. 
 'Now confess that you feel like the bridegroom in Gogol's play who jumped out of the window?' teased Chirikov. 
 'Ah, but your soul is in such chaos at the present moment that you are unable to find anything there! Wait till you've settled down a bit, then you'll find it,' said Katavasov. 
 'No, I should even now have some consciousness that despite my feelings' (he did not wish in Katavasov's presence to use the word love) 'and my happiness I was yet sorry to lose my freedom. 
 Happiness consists only in loving and desiring: in wishing her wishes and in thinking her thoughts, which means having no freedom whatever; that is happiness!' 
 'But do I know her thoughts, wishes, or feelings?' a voice suddenly whispered. 
 And strange and most evil thoughts about her came into his mind. He became jealous of Vronsky just as he had been the year before, as if it had been but yesterday that he saw her with him. 
 'No, this won't do!' he said to himself despairingly. 'I will go to her and tell her for the last time that we are now free, and that perhaps we had better keep so! 
 'Oh!' she cried when she saw him, and her face lit up with joy. 'Why have you...? 
 I will call you,' said Kitty. 'What is the matter with you?' she asked as soon as the maid was gone. 
 I cannot bear it alone,' he cried in a despairing tone, standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes. 
 Already in her loving, truthful face he could read that what he was going to tell her would lead to nothing, yet he felt that he still wanted to hear her disavowal. 
 Kitty had not only assured him that she loved him, but had even given him, in answer to his question, the reasons why. 
 'She has scarcely eaten anything all these days and has grown quite plain; and here you come and upset her with your nonsense!' said she. 'Be off, be off, my dear!' 
 His brother, Dolly, and Oblonsky, all in evening dress, were waiting to bless him with the icon. 
 Dolly had to return home to fetch her son, who, his hair oiled and curled, was to drive in the bride's carriage and hold an icon. 
 Dolly did the same, then she hurried away and again became confused about the arrangements for the carriages. 
 More carriages kept driving up, and now ladies with flowers in their hair got out, holding up their trains; or men appeared who doffed their military caps or black hats as they entered the church. 
 Inside the building the candles in both chandeliers were already lit, as well as all the candles in front of the icons. 
 Every time the door creaked every one turned round, expecting to see the bride and bridegroom enter. 
 But in the corridor there was nobody, and in despair he returned and addressed Oblonsky, who was quietly smoking. 
 'Yes, it is stupid,' Oblonsky concurred with a soothing smile. 'But don't worry, it will be here in a minute.' 
 He glanced at his crumpled shirt-front. 'And suppose the things have already gone to the station!' he exclaimed in despair. 
 The fact of the matter was that when Levin told his old servant Kuzma to get his things ready, Kuzma had duly brought his dress coat, waistcoat and what else he considered necessary. 
 The shirt Levin had been wearing since the morning was crumpled and quite unfit to wear with the fashionable low-cut waistcoat. 
 They sent for one of Oblonsky's, but it was much too wide and too short. 
 'That won't help matters,' remarked Oblonsky, smiling and following without haste. 'It will all "shape itself," all "shape itself'... 
 'It was such a stupid thing that happened! 
 I am ashamed to tell it,' he said with a blush, and was obliged to turn round to the approaching Sergius Ivanich. 
 'Now then, Kostya!' said Oblonsky, feigning consternation. 'You've got to decide an important point, and you're in exactly the right frame of mind to appreciate its importance. 
 'Kitty, mind you step first upon the mat!' said Countess Nordston, coming up to them. 'You are a fine fellow!' she added, addressing Levin. 
 When at last he had taken her hand properly, the priest went a few steps in front of them and halted at the lectern. 
 Oblonsky stepped up cautiously, whispered something to him, made a sign to Levin, and stepped back again. 
 The priest lit two wax candles decorated with flowers, and holding them askew in his left hand so that the wax kept slowly dripping, turned to the young couple. 
 She did not turn, but her high frilled collar moved, rising to her pink little ear. 
 The handsome, tall senior deacon in a silver cloth alb, his curled hair parted down the middle, came briskly forward lifting his stole with a practised movement of two fingers, and stopped opposite the priest. 
 'Bless us, Lord!' slowly succeeding one another, and vibratingly resonant, came the solemn tones. 
 'Blessed be our God, now and hereafter, for ever and ever!' replied the old priest meekly, in a sing-song voice, continuing to turn something over on the lectern. 
 There were prayers as usual for the world above, for salvation, for the Synod, for the Emperor, and also for the servants of God that day wedded, Constantine and Catherine. 
 She understood hardly anything of the service and was not even listening to the words of the ceremony. 
 She could neither listen nor understand, so deep was the one feeling that filled her soul and became ever stronger and stronger. 
 Those six weeks had been the most blissful and at the same time the most trying of her life. 
 She could not think of or desire anything but life with this man; but, as that life had not yet begun, she could not even clearly picture it to herself. 
 'Why is Marie in lilac? It's almost as unsuitable at a wedding as black,' remarked Mrs. Korsunskaya. 
 'With her complexion it's her only salvation,' replied Princess Drubetskaya. 
 'They say that one who has been best man more than ten times never marries, and I wanted to be one for the tenth time to make myself safe, but was too late,' Count Sinyavin was saying to the pretty young Princess Charskaya, who had designs on him. 
 'No, I like him very much, and not just because he will be my brother-in-law,' answered the Princess. 
 Among the brides that came to her mind was her dear Anna, about whose impending divorce she had heard a while ago. 
 But whatever you may say, one does feel sorry for a girl.' So chattered the crowd of women who had managed to get inside the church. 
 After the usual questions of whether they wished to be married and whether they had promised themselves to others, and their answers, which sounded strange to themselves, the second part of the service began. 
 'Put it quite on!' came the words of advice when the priest had put crowns on their heads and Shcherbatsky, his hand in its three-buttoned glove trembling, held the crown high above Kitty's head. 
 Levin fancied that the priest and deacon wanted to smile just as he did. 
 He could not believe it was all true and only realized it when their surprised and timid glances met and he felt that they were already one. 
 On leaving the Corps the two friends had separated and had met but once since then. 
 On that occasion Vronsky found that Golenishchev had chosen some high-flown Liberal activity and therefore felt he must despise Vronsky's profession and activities. 
 And Golenishchev had remained contemptuously indifferent to Vronsky's attitude, so that that meeting ought to have separated them still further. 
 Yet now they brightened up and exclaimed with pleasure at recognizing one another. 
 Vronsky would never have thought he could be so pleased to see Golenishchev, but probably he was himself unaware how bored he was. 
 He forgot the unpleasant impression left by their last encounter, and with an open and joyful countenance held out his hand to his old schoolfellow. 
 Three days,' answered Vronsky, still attentively scrutinizing his friend's face. 
 They pretended to understand completely the significance and meaning of the situation, to countenance and even approve of it, but to consider it out of place and unnecessary to explain all this. 
 Noticing Anna's good-natured, bright, and energetic manner, he thought that, knowing both Karenin and Vronsky as he did, he quite understood her. 
 From her look Vronsky understood that she did not yet know what attitude he wished to adopt toward Golenishchev, and was afraid she might not have behaved suitably. 
 'I am very pleased about one thing,' said Anna to Golenishchev when they had returned to the hotel. 
 The memory of the evil done to her husband aroused in her a feeling akin to repulsion, such as a man might feel who when in danger of drowning had shaken off another who clung to him. 
 I must go on suffering from the degradation and by the separation from my son.' But sincerely as Anna desired to suffer, she was not suffering. 
 The parting from her son, whom she loved, did not trouble her at first either. 
 But she could not help being grateful to him for his treatment of her, and showing him how much she valued it. 
 He was even more lovingly respectful to her than before, and the thought that she must never be allowed to feel the awkwardness of her situation never left his mind for a moment. 
 She could not help appreciating this, although his strained attentiveness, the atmosphere of solicitude with which he surrounded her, became burdensome at times. 
 He soon felt that the realization of his longing gave him only one grain of the mountain of bliss he had anticipated. 
 Involuntarily he began to snatch at every passing caprice, mistaking it for a desire and a purpose. 
 As a hungry animal seizes every object it meets, hoping to find food in it, so Vronsky unconsciously seized now on politics, now on new books, now on pictures. 
 The role Vronsky had chosen, with their removal to the palazzo, was quite successful; and having through Golenishchev made the acquaintance of several interesting persons, he felt tranquil for a time. 
 The article reproached the Government and the Academy for leaving a remarkable artist without encouragement or help. 
 Vronsky too looked out of the window and into Anna's eyes, and at once turned to Golenishchev saying: 
 When he entered the Academy and won a reputation for himself he, not being stupid, wanted to get same education. 
 Golenishchev pulled himself up and unwillingly agreed, but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage. 
 'Then you shouldn't get into arrears! It's not my fault! 
 He never worked with such ardour or so successfully as when things were going badly with him, and especially after a quarrel with his wife. 'Oh dear! 
 If only I could escape somewhere!' he thought as he worked. He was sketching the figure of a man in a fit of anger. 
 Where is it?' He went back to his wife, and frowning, without looking at her, asked his eldest little girl where the paper was that he had given them. 
 Nevertheless, he took it, put it on his table, and, stepping backward and screwing up his eyes, began examining it. 
 'That's it! That's it!' he said, and taking up his pencil he began drawing rapidly. 
 He laughed with joy, for the inanimate, unnatural figure had become alive, and was just the thing. 
 It was possible to correct the drawing to accord with the requirements of the pose; it was possible and even necessary to place the feet further apart, to alter the position of the left arm, and to throw back the hair. 
 Having made it up with his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar, and a hat, and went to the studio. 
 His successful drawing was already forgotten. 
 He did not consider his picture better than all Raphael's, but he knew that what he wanted to express in that picture had never yet been expressed by anyone. 
 The visitors, already disenchanted by Golenishchev's account of the artist, were still further disillusioned by his appearance. 
 ON ENTERING HIS STUDIO the artist again cast a glance at his visitors and took note of Vronsky's face, especially his jaw. 
 But in spite of all this, as he turned over his studies, pulled up the blinds, and withdrew the sheet from his picture, he felt very excited – all the more so because, though he regarded distinguished and wealthy Russians as mostly beasts and fools, Vronsky and especially Anna pleased him. 
 'There!' he said, stepping aside with his loose gait, and pointing to the picture. 
 He saw in the foreground Pilate's vexed face and Christ's calm one, and behind them the faces of Pilate's servants and of John, watching what was taking place. 
 To break it and to appear calm, he made an effort and addressed Golenishchev. 
 We first met at Rossi's. Don't you remember that evening when the Italian lady recited – the new Rachel?' began Golenishchev glibly, turning away from the picture to the artist without the slightest regret. 
 He wanted to speak but was too agitated, and pretended to cough instead. 
 His opinion of that figure was the same. 
 He took a liking for Golenishchev because of that remark, and his depression changed suddenly into delight. 
 Of course there was an official expression in Pilate's face and pity in Christ's, for the former was the embodiment of carnal and the latter of spiritual life. 
 He knew it meant a mechanical capacity to paint and draw, quite independent of the subject-matter. 
 Moreover, he saw that if technique were spoken of, then he could not be praised for it. 
 I consider that if Christ is to be brought down to the level of an historic figure, it would be better to choose another historic theme, a fresh one as yet untouched.' 
 Yet Ivanov's picture suggests both to a believer and an unbeliever the question: Is this a God or not a God? And the unity of impression is destroyed.' 
 'Why so? To me it seems that for educated people such questions can no longer exist,' said Mikhaylov. 
 Golenishchev did not agree with this, and keeping to his first contention that unity of impression is indispensable in art, he confuted Mikhaylov. The artist was perturbed, but could find nothing to say in defence of his opinion. 
 To Mikhaylov, in his excitement over their visit, this mention of money matters was very disagreeable. 
 The foreshortening of Christ's foot was, however, not right. 
 He could work neither when he was too indifferent nor when he was too highly roused and saw everything too distinctly. 
 There was only one stage between calmness and inspiration, at which work was possible, and to-day he was too excited. 
 'How long have I been struggling without accomplishing anything?' he said, referring to the portrait he was painting; 'and he just looked, and painted this! 
 Altogether, his reserved, disagreeable, and apparently hostile attitude when they came to know him better much displeased them, and they were glad when the sittings were over, the beautiful portrait was theirs, and his visits ceased. 
 He merely left off painting Anna, deciding that it would be superfluous now. 
 And he, as well as Golenishchev, and especially Anna, thought it very good because it resembled famous pictures much more than Mikhaylov's did. 
 It was this kind of unpleasantness that Mikhaylov experienced when he saw Vronsky's pictures: he was amused, vexed, sorry, and hurt. 
 He ceased painting it because he was dimly conscious that its defects, little noticeable at first, would become striking if he went on. 
 But Golenishchev was embittered and tormented by it, while Vronsky could not deceive and torment himself, and above all could not become embittered. 
 With characteristic firmness he left off painting, without any explanations or excuses. 
 He was happy, but having embarked on family life he saw at every step that it was not at all what he had anticipated. 
 In his future married life he was sure he would have nothing of this kind, and even the external forms of his married life would be quite unlike other people's. 
 Without herself knowing why or wherefore, the management of the house attracted her irresistibly. 
 Instinctively feeling the approach of spring, and knowing that there would be wet weather, she built her nest as she could, hastening to build it while yet learning how to do it. 
 'You seem merry...' she began, wishing to say something calmly stinging. 
 But directly she opened her mouth, words of reproach, senseless jealousy, and everything else that had been torturing her during the half-hour she had sat motionless waiting at the window, burst from her. 
 He understood this by a tormenting sensation of cleavage which he experienced at that moment. 
 Far an instant he was offended, but immediately knew he could not be offended with her because she was himself. 
 Never again did he feel this so strongly as this first time, and for a long time he could not recover his balance. 
 Like a man half-asleep and oppressed with pain, he wanted to tear off the aching part and cast it from him, but found on waking that the aching part was – himself. 
 Having realized that she was in the wrong, though she did not acknowledge it, she became more tender to him, and they enjoyed a new and doubled happiness in their love. 
 All that time they were conscious of peculiar strain, as if the chain that bound them were being pulled first one way and then the other. 
 He used to feel that without it life would be too dismal, and now he needed it in order that his life should not be too monotonously bright. 
 Having set to work again on his manuscript and read over what he had written, he was glad to find, that the work seemed worth doing. 
 Many of his former thoughts now appeared superfluous and extreme, but many omissions became clear to him when he went over the matter afresh. 
 'Oh dear! How sweet and silly he is, jealous of me! 
 Well!' and she opened her eyes wider, trying thereby to increase the force of her look. 
 'Yes, they divert all the sap, they produce a false glamour,' he muttered, pausing, and feeling that she was looking at him he turned round smiling. 
 'Nothing, I only wanted to make you turn round,' said she, gazing at him and trying to discover whether he was vexed at the interruption. 
 For me, I mean...' he said, coming toward her with a beaming smile of happiness. 
 Go and write, don't let me distract you,' she said, puckering her lips. 'And I must cut out these little holes, you see!' 
 He smiled at his thought and shook his head disapprovingly at it. A feeling resembling repentance tormented him. 
 'Soon it will be three months since I did anything worth mentioning. 
 This is almost the first day that I have really set to work seriously and what has come of it? 
 'You see, your lady has made me sit with her,' said Agatha Mikhaylovna, glancing with a friendly smile at Kitty. 
 He perceived that despite Agatha Mikhaylovna's grief at the advent of the new mistress who had taken the reins of management into her own hands, Kitty had conquered and had made the old woman love her. 
 I've read your letter,' said Kitty, handing him a badly-written letter. 'It is from that woman, I think – your brother's... 
 But Levin did not listen. He blushed as he took Mary Nikolavna's letter. 
 This time she wrote differently: she had found Nicholas Dmitrich, had joined him in Moscow, and had gone with him to a provincial town where he had obtained a post in the Civil Service. 
 The tone in which her husband had said these words hurt her, especially as he evidently disbelieved what she had said. 
 'Well, if only because that woman is there, with whom you cannot associate...' 
 But just think, this matter is so important – it hurts me to think that you are mixing up with it your weakness, your dislike of remaining alone. 
 'I am all right, not weak, nor anything... I feel that it's my duty to be with my husband when he is in trouble, but you wish to hurt me on purpose, you purposely don't want to understand me!' 
 'No, this is awful... being a sort of slave!' exclaimed Levin, unable to restrain his annoyance any longer, but immediately conscious that he had dealt a blow to himself. 
 He began speaking, trying to find words not so much to dissuade as to pacify her. 
 He stooped and took her resisting hand; he kissed her hand, her hair, and again her hand, but she remained silent. 
 But when he took her face in his hands and said 'Kitty!' she suddenly recovered, cried a little, and then they made it up. 
 Still less could he with conviction agree that the woman who was with his brother did not matter, and he thought with terror of all the encounters that might take place. 
 Levin blushed with shame and vexation at his wife for having placed herself and him in this awkward position; but Mary Nikolavna blushed still more. 
 He had expected to find the physical signs of approaching death more definite: greater weakness, greater emaciation, but still the same sort of condition generally. 
 Levin could see the moist thin hair on the temples and the drawn transparent-looking forehead. 
 Just take me there and then go away,' she began. 'Try and realize that for me to see you and not to see him is much more painful. 
 When he entered the sickroom his eyes and his attention became clouded without his being conscious of it, and he did not see or distinguish the various details of his brother's condition. 
 This made Levin's position still harder. 
 Those very details, the thought of which alone filled her husband with horror, at once arrested her attention. 
 She herself went several times to their own room and, without paying any attention to the people she met, brought back with her sheets, pillow-cases, towels, and shirts. 
 When Levin opened the door, on his return from the doctor's whither Kitty had sent him, he saw the invalid at the moment when at Kitty's command Mary Nikolavna and the waiter were putting a clean shirt on him. 
 'There is a little bottle in my handbag,' she went on, turning to her husband. 'You know, in the side pocket! 
 The new doctor took out a stethoscope and sounded him, shook his head, prescribed some medicine and gave extremely precise instructions about giving the medicine and about diet. 
 How pleasant!' He took her hand and drew it toward his lips, but as if fearful that this might be disagreeable to her he changed his mind, let her hand drop, and merely stroked it. 
 She understood because her mind incessantly watched for his needs. 
 Levin, trembling, choking with sobs and unable to utter a word, left the room. 
 The proof that they knew surely what death was, lay in the fact that they knew without a minute's hesitation how to behave with the dying and did not fear them. 
 More than that, he did not know what to say, how to look, or how to step. To talk of indifferent things seemed an affront, and he could not do it; to talk of death and dismal things was likewise impossible, and it was equally impossible to keep silent. 
 When Levin returned to their two rooms for the night he sat with hanging head not knowing what to do. 
 'Yes, you see that woman Mary Nikolavna could not arrange all that,' said Levin. 'I... 
 'I quite believe it, quite. 
 He said, addressing himself to God, 'If Thou dost exist, heal this man (such things have often happened), and Thou wilt save both him and me!' 
 'Better – Yes, much better. – Wonderful! – It is not at all wonderful. Still, he's better!' they said in whispers, smiling at one another. 
 The reality of his sufferings destroyed it, leaving no trace nor even any recollection of the former hopes, in Levin, Kitty, or the patient himself. 
 'Kitty is not here?' he asked hoarsely, glancing round when Levin had reluctantly confirmed the doctor's statement. 'No? 
 Then I can tell you... It's for her sake I went through that comedy – she is such a dear! 
 Between seven and eight o'clock that evening Levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when Mary Nikolavna rushed in breathless. 
 'He is dying!' she whispered. 'I'm afraid he'll die immediately.' 
 He did not lift his head but only turned up his eyes, failing to reach his brother's face. 'Kate, go away,' he added. 
 'I'll soon be lying,' he said softly. 'Dead!' he added cynically and angrily. 
 He felt that despite all his mental efforts he could not understand what was 'so' and was already lagging far behind his dying brother. 
 If he had any feeling left for him it was more like envy of that knowledge which the dying man now possessed and which he might not share. 
 For a long time he sat leaning over Nicholas, waiting for the end. 
 He wished to eat and sleep. 
 He again sat up, coughed, ate and talked, no longer of death, expressed hopes of recovery, and was even more irritable and depressed than before. 
 That consciousness of death which had been evoked in them all by his farewell to life on the night he had sent for his brother was destroyed. 
 Every one knew he would soon and inevitably die, that he was already half dead. 
 Levin, who had long wished to reconcile his brothers, even if only at the moment of death, had written to Sergius Ivanich, and having received his answer read it to Nicholas. 
 Every one who saw him now desired his death: the waiters in the hotel, the proprietor, all the other visitors there, the doctor, Mary Nikolavna, Levin, and Kitty. 
 There was no position that did not cause him pain; no moments of forgetfulness; no part of his body that did not hurt and torment him. 
 Even the memories, impressions, and thoughts, within his body now aroused in him the same sort of repulsion as the body itself. 
 He had no words to express his desire for this liberation, and therefore did not speak of it; but went on from habit demanding satisfaction of those wishes that could be fulfilled. 'Turn me on the other side,' he said, and immediately afterwards asked to be put back as he had been. 
 The doctor confirmed their supposition about Kitty. Her illness was pregnancy. 
 What was most painful in his situation was his inability to reconcile his past life with the present state of things. 
 Without rendering account to himself why he did it, during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent. 
 Karenin appeared to be considering, when suddenly he turned round and sat down at the table. 
 Karenin, left alone, realized that he could not any longer maintain an appearance of firmness and calm. 
 She found him in the posture in which he had long sat, resting his head on his hands. 
 Karenin rose frowning, and disengaging his hand moved a chair toward her. 
 'It is not the loss of what no longer exists, it is not that,' continued Karenin. 
 'It is not you who have performed that great act of forgiveness which fills me and everybody else with rapture, but He that dwells within your heart,' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, turning up her eyes ecstatically, 'and therefore you must not be ashamed of your action.' 
 'One must know all the details,' he said in a high-pitched voice. 'Human strength has its limits, Countess, and I have reached the limits of mine. 
 All day long I have had to take domestic decisions resulting from' (he emphasized the word 'resulting') 'my new solitary position. The servants, the governess, the bills... 
 'I understand it all. Not in me will you find help and consolation, though I have come to help you if I can. 
 'But, my dear friend, do not give way to that feeling you were speaking about – of being ashamed of that which is the utmost height of Christianity! "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted," and you must not thank me! – You must thank Him, and ask Him for help. 
 And raising her eyes to Heaven she began to pray, as Karenin understood from her silence. 
 For Karenin it was easy to accept that interpretation. 
 Since then, though not divorced, they lived apart; and when the husband did meet his wife he always treated her with an unchanging venomous irony which seemed inexplicable. 
 She was not only glad to meet him, but searched his face for signs of the impression she created on him. 
 I entreat you to permit me to see him once before my departure. 
 Knowing your friendship for him, I feel that you will understand me. 
 You cannot imagine the yearning I have to see him, and therefore cannot imagine the gratitude which your help will awaken in me. – 
 'I must talk over an important and sad matter with you, and we can arrange where. 
 He sends a cross, but He also sends strength to bear it,' she added, to prepare him somewhat. 
 She liked that way of communicating with him, which had an elegance and secrecy absent in their personal interviews. 
 He will not release that unfortunate fellow until he has expounded everything, point by point.' 
 'C'est un homme qui n'a pas...' [That's a man who has not...] began the chamberlain, but stopped short to make way for and to bow to a member of the Imperial family who passed by. 
 He still held an important post, was member of many Commissions and Committees, but he was finished, and from him nothing further was to be looked for. 
 But Karenin, far from noticing the hopelessness of his position in officialdom and being troubled by it, was more satisfied with his work than ever. 
 'Ah, Alexis Alexandrovich !' cried the old man with a malevolent gleam in his eyes as Karenin passed him bowing coldly. 'I have not yet congratulated you,' he went on, pointing to Karenin's newly-awarded ribbon. 
 Lydia Ivanovna's dress had cost her a great deal of trouble, as was the case with all her attire of late. 
 'How is our angel ?' asked she, meaning Serezha. 
 When with Lydia Ivanovna's help he had returned to life and activity, he had felt it his duty to take his son's education in hand. 
 Karenin started at the reference to his wife, but immediately his face assumed a death-like immobility which showed utter helplessness in the matter. 
 I understand immorality,' she said, not quite sincerely, for she never could have understood that which leads women to immorality, 'but I do not understand cruelty... and to whom? 
 But it's quite true, "Live and learn"! And I am learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness.' 
 He now felt a similar sense of shame and remorse when thinking of his whole past with her, and recalling the awkward words in which, after much hesitation, he had proposed to her. 
 'Well, has the bandaged official been to-day? Has Papa seen him?' 
 'Serezha!' said his tutor, a Slav, stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms, 'take it off yourself.' 
 The bandaged official, who had called seven times to petition Karenin about something, interested both Serezha and the hall-porter. 
 But Vasily Lukich only thought that Serezha must prepare his grammar lesson, as his teacher was coming at two. 
 'Even you don't know!' And Serezha, leaning his elbows on the table, began to reflect. 
 The teacher was not only dissatisfied but also saddened. His sadness touched Serezha. 
 It is just a day like any other, on which we must work.' 
 Before his father came Serezha sat at the table playing with a pocket-knife and thinking. 
 He expected that at any moment she would approach and lift her veil. 
 The lady did not come up to them and disappeared somewhere. 
 To-day Serezha was more than ever conscious of a flow of love for his mother in his heart, and now as he sat lost in thought, waiting for his father, he notched the whole edge of the table with his knife, looking before him with shining eyes and thinking about her. 
 'She told me you had received another Order, a new one. Are you glad, Papa?' 
 The part, however, about which he could not say anything at all but only floundered, cut the table, and rocked his chair, was that about the antediluvian patriarchs. 
 But he was told that everybody would die; he had even asked people whom he trusted and they all confirmed it; his nurse too said so, though reluctantly. 
 If you do not take pains to know what is most necessary for a Christian, then what can interest you? 
 I am displeased with you, and Peter Ignatych' – this was the chief educationalist – 'is also displeased with you... 
 His father from his point of view considered that the boy did not try to learn what he was being taught. 
 He could not, because there were more urgent demands on his soul than those put forward by his father and the educationalist. 
 You'd better tell me,' said Vasily Lukich, smiling, which he rarely did. 'Well, lie down, and I'll put out the candle.' 
 When the candle had been taken away he heard and felt his mother. She stood above him and caressed him with a loving look. 
 On the day they arrived Vronsky went to see his brother. There he met his mother, who had come from Moscow on business. 
 His mother and his sister-in-law received him just as usual, asked him about his trip abroad and spoke of mutual acquaintances, but did not say a single word about his union with Anna. 
 Despite all his experience of the world, Vronsky, in the new position in which he found himself, was making a terrible mistake. 
 Though in the depths of his soul he knew that Society was closed to them, he tried whether it would not change and whether it would not receive them. 
 As in the game of cat and mouse, the arms that were raised to allow him to get inside the circle were at once lowered to prevent Anna from entering. 
 He knew that his mother, who had been so delighted with Anna when she first made her acquaintance, was now merciless toward her for having caused the ruin of her son's career. 
 The day after his arrival Vronsky called on her, and having found her alone, expressed his wish. 
 Perhaps in her place I should have done the same. I do not and cannot enter into details,' she added, looking timidly into his gloomy face. 
 'I am not angry with you,' he said just as gloomily, 'but I am doubly pained. 
 Vronsky understood that it was vain to make any further attempts and that they would have to spend those few days in Petersburg as in a strange town, avoiding contact with their former world in order not to lay themselves open to unpleasantnesses and insults which were so painful to him. 
 It was impossible to start any conversation without its turning upon Karenin, impossible to go anywhere without meeting him. 
 The nearer they came to Petersburg the greater its joy and importance appeared. 
 It was painful to her even to think of writing to and coming into contact with her husband: she could be calm only when she did not think of him. 
 Having spent all that day at the hotel considering how she might see her son, she resolved to write to her husband. 
 She drove to a toy shop, purchased a lot of toys, and devised a plan of action. She would go early in the morning, at about eight, when Karenin would certainly not be up. 
 Next morning Anna went alone, and at eight o'clock got out of the hired carriage and rang the bell at the front door of the house which used to be her home. 
 Noticing the stranger's confusion, Kapitonich himself came out, admitted her, and inquired what she wanted. 
 One memory after another, both joyful and painful, rose in her mind, and for a moment she forgot why she had come. 
 Please excuse its not being quite clean. He has been moved to the old sitting-room now,' said the hall-porter, panting. 
 I'll just look in,' he said, having overtaken her. He opened a big door and vanished behind it. 
 Just as he spoke Anna heard the sounds of a child yawning; she recognized her son by the sound of the yawn and pictured him vividly before her. 
 She recognized and yet did not quite recognize his bare legs, now so big; which he had freed from the blanket, and his cheeks, now grown thinner, and the short locks of hair at the back of his head where she had so often kissed him. 
 She tried to speak simply and cheerfully, but could not, and turned away again. 
 'You don't want that,' he said, taking off her bonnet and on seeing her without it, he began kissing her again as though he had only just seen her. 
 'Soldier!' said Korney, contemptuously, and turned to the nurse who had just entered. 
 'He's let her in without telling anybody; and Alexis Alexandrovich will be ready in a minute and will go to the nursery.' 
 What a business!' said the nurse. 'You must detain him somehow, Korney Vasilich – the master, I mean! 
 And I'll run and get her out of the way. What a business!' 
 When the nurse entered, Serezha was just telling his mother how he and Nadenka fell down together when ice-hilling, and turned three somersaults. 
 She could not say good-bye, but the expression of her face said it and he understood. 'Darling, darling Kutik!' she said, calling him by the pet name she used when he was quite little, 'you won't forget me? 
 The French maid, whom she had brought from abroad, came and asked whether she would not dress. She looked at her in astonishment and replied, 'Later.' 
 A waiter offered her coffee. 'Later,' she said. 
 She returned the baby to its nurse, sent them away, and opened a locket with Serezha's portrait as a baby about the same age as the little girl. 
 This was his most characteristic and best expression. 
 She caught hold of a corner of this photo several times with her deft little hand, the slender white fingers of which moved with special strenuousness that day, but each time they slipped and she could not get the picture out. 
 How can he leave me alone in my anguish?' she suddenly thought with a sense of reproach, forgetting that she herself had hidden from him all that concerned her son. She sent to ask him to come up to her at once. 
 When she entered the drawing-room not his eyes but Yashvin's met hers. 
 Let me have them,' she added, with a rapid movement taking from Vronsky the photos he was looking at, and glancing at him impressively with glistening eyes. 
 After a short talk, noticing that Vronsky looked at the clock, Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying long in Petersburg, and straightening his immense body picked up his cap. 
 'I am late as it is,' he answered. 'Go on! 
 'Alexis, you have not changed toward me?' she asked, squeezing his hand in both hers. 'Alexis, I am in torment here! 
 The Princess asked to be excused for not coming to say good-bye; she was not well, but asked Anna to come and see her between half-past six and nine. 
 At dinner Anna was aggressively merry, seeming to flirt with both Tushkevich and Yashvin. 
 Anna was already dressed in a light silk dress cut low in front and trimmed with velvet – a dress she had had made in Paris; and on her head she wore some rich, white lace, which outlined her face and set off her brilliant beauty to great advantage. 
 I love you, and it's all the same to me,' she said, changing from French into Russian, while her eyes as she looked at him glittered with a light he could not understand, 'so long as you have not changed toward me! 
 This conversation about horses interested him, but he never forgot Anna, and involuntarily listened to the steps in the corridor and glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece. 
 'Anna Arkadyevna sent me to say that she has gone to the theatre,' said a servant. 
 Left alone, Vronsky got up and began pacing the room. 
 As he made this gesture he struck the little table on which the seltzer and a decanter of brandy were standing and almost knocked it over. 
 The attendant, an old man, helped him off with his overcoat, recognized him and, addressing him as 'Your Excellency,' suggested that he need not take a ticket for his coat, but should merely call for 'Theodore' when he wanted it. 
 The door opened to let an attendant slip through, and the nearly completed phrase struck Vronsky's ears distinctly. 
 To-day he paid less attention than ever to the familiar surroundings: the stage, the noise, and all that well-known, uninteresting, motley herd of audience in the packed theatre. 
 I, when I come back from abroad and put this on again, regret my freedom,' he said, touching his shoulder-knot. 
 Serpukhovskoy had long ago ceased to trouble himself about Vronsky's career, but was as fond of him as ever and was particularly amiable to him now. 
 Vronsky heard them mention the name of Karenin, and noticed how the Commander hastened to call him loudly by name, with a significant glance at the others. 
 Having conducted the Princess Sorokina back to Vronsky's mother, Varya held out her hand to her brother-in-law and at once began to talk of the matter that interested him. 
 Her husband began conversing with her from his box, and Kartasova flew at him! 
 [She is making a sensation. They are forgetting Patti because of her.] 
 He was disturbed both by vexation with Anna for placing herself and him in this false position, and by pity for her sufferings. 
 'Like Prince Yashvin, who considers that Patti sings too loud,' she returned with a smile. 'Thank you!' she said, taking with her small gloved hand a programme Vronsky had picked up for her: and suddenly at that instant her beautiful face quivered. 
 She rose and went to the back of the box. 
 'The words of a silly woman;' he said. 'But why risk it? 
 'Ah, well! there's no time now,' added Koznyshev as the children came running in. 
 'I'm coming, Mlle Varenka,' said Koznyshev, drinking up his coffee and pocketing his handkerchief and cigarcase. 
 'You quite forget your condition, Kitty,' said the old Princess, hurrying in. 'You should not shout so.' 
 What a skilful matchmaker!' teased Dolly. 'How carefully and adroitly she brings them together!' 
 He,' he meant Koznyshev, 'could have made the best match in Russia any time; now he is no longer so young, but all the same I am sure many would marry him even now... 
 'Secondly, his position in the world is such that neither property nor the social position of his wife matters to him at all. 
 He only needs a good, sweet, quiet wife.' 
 'Thirdly, she must love him; and that too is... In a word, it would be splendid! 
 There is a sort of barrier, and suddenly down it goes,' said Dolly with a dreamy smile, recalling her past with Oblonsky. 
 Your relations with him could not have gone beyond what was proper, else I should have spoken to him myself! 
 'How happily it turned out for Kitty that Anna came,' said Dolly, 'and how unhappily for her! 
 The exact reverse,' she added, struck by her thought. 'Then Anna was so happy and Kitty considered herself miserable. 
 'What is the use of talking about that?' expostulated Kitty with vexation. 
 'Well?' he asked, looking at her with the expression with which every one addressed her nowadays. 
 'Please follow my advice,' said the old Princess, 'cover the jam with paper soaked in rum, and then it will not get mouldy, even without ice.' 
 'No. I am so glad of a chance to be alone with you; and I own that, nice as it is to have them all, I regret our winter evenings alone together.' 
 'What do you think about it?' and she looked into his face. 
 I remember him at that time. He was wonderfully charming. 
 'Why not speak of him?' he added. 'Sometimes I blame myself for not doing so, it will end by my forgetting him. 
 'You think he can't fall in love, then?' said Kitty, putting his thoughts into her own words. 
 Her disbelief in his dissatisfaction with himself was pleasant, and unconsciously he challenged her to give reasons for her disbelief. 
 But one must have your father's simplicity, clearness, and kindness, and have I got all that? 
 So you think he will propose to-day?' he added after a pause. 
 Wait, we'll see.' She stooped and picked an ox-eye daisy by the roadside. 
 'There, begin! He will propose, he won't...' and she handed him the flower. 
 When he had gone some forty paces he stepped behind a spindle bush with pink and red earring-shaped blossoms, and paused, knowing that he could no longer be seen. 
 But it is nothing of the kind. The one thing I can find against it is that when I lost Marie I told myself that I would remain true to her memory. 
 The third was: she was religious, not irresponsibly religious and kind-hearted like a child – like Kitty for instance but her life was based on religious convictions. 
 Varenka, who had bent to pick a mushroom, rose buoyantly and glanced round. 
 'MLLE VARENKA! WHEN VERY YOUNG I formed my ideal of the woman I should love and whom I should be happy to call my wife. 
 Kneeling and with outstretched arms defending some mushrooms from Grisha, she was calling little Masha. 
 On seeing Koznyshev approaching she did not move; yet everything told him that she felt his approach and was glad of it. 
 They had gone far enough not to be overheard, but he still had not begun. 
 He wished to bring her back to her first remark about her childhood; but without wishing to, after a pause, he replied to her last words: 
 She was frightened: frightened of what he might or might not say. 
 'The stem of the birch-tree boletus reminds one of a dark man's beard two days old,' remarked Koznyshev calmly. 
 'Won't bite,' answered Kitty with a smile and manner of speaking like her father, which Levin often observed in her with pleasure. 
 Every one talked with peculiar animation about extraneous topics. 
 Their happiness in their love involved an unpleasant reflection on those who desired, but had failed, to secure the same happiness, and made them feel ashamed. 
 'And I know why,' continued the Princess. 'He says young married folk should be left to themselves for a while.' 
 'Yes, Papa has really abandoned us,' said Kitty. We have not seen him... 
 And are we young married folk?... Why, we are such old ones now!' 
 'What is it, Agatha Mikhaylovna?' Kitty asked suddenly when the old woman stopped in front of her with a look of mystery and importance. 
 'Oh, that's just right,' said Dolly. 'You go and give your orders, and I will hear Grisha his lesson. 
 'No, I will go, Dolly! You stay here,' he said. 
 'We shall do it all properly by the book. Only when Steve comes we shall go shooting and then I shall miss the lessons.' 
 Dolly had not had time to rise to go to meet her husband, before Levin had jumped out of the window of the room below, where he had been teaching Grisha, and had lifted the boy out too. 
 When he came nearer he saw, sitting beside Oblonsky, a stout handsome young man wearing a Scotch bonnet with long ribbons streaming behind. 
 They have not been in Moscow since then.... Here, Tanya! 
 Even Koznyshev, who had also come out of the porch displeased Levin by the feigned friendliness with which he greeted Oblonsky, whom, as Levin knew, he neither liked nor respected. 
 It was long since the farm work had seemed so important to him as it did that evening. 'For them it is always a holiday,' he thought, 'yet here we have work that is no holiday task, which cannot be put off, and without which life is impossible.' 
 LEVIN DID NOT RETURN until they called him to supper. 
 On the stairs stood Kitty and Agatha Mikhaylovna, deliberating what wines to serve. 
 'Oh no, stay here, Dolly dear!' said Oblonsky, stepping across to her side of the long supper-table. 'I have much more to tell you.' 
 Moreover, he saw his wife had an expression of serious feeling as she gazed attentively at Vasenka's handsome face while he was vivaciously narrating something. 
 Oblonsky asked his wife. 
 'Are you acquainted with Anna Arkadyevna?' Veslovsky asked her. 
 'No, wait a day, because Dolly has seen nothing of her husband. 
 Levin now interpreted her words thus: 'Do not part me from him. 
 Meanwhile Vasenka, without the least suspicion of the sufferings his presence was causing, rose from the table after Kitty and followed her, smiling pleasantly. 
 In Levin's eyes Kitty was to blame for having laid herself open to such behaviour, and still more to blame for so awkwardly showing that it displeased her. 
 'Oh no Kostya! Wait – listen!' she implored with a look of pained commiseration. 
 'Well then, I will keep him here all the summer on purpose. I will lavish attentions on him,' said Levin, kissing her hands. 
 Oblonsky was wearing raw hide shoes, bands of linen wound round his feet instead of socks, a pair of tattered trousers and a short coat. 
 'Let them out with the flock,' he said, turning to the herdsman who was waiting for orders about some young sheep. 'Sorry! 
 'You should have obeyed me,' said Levin with vexation. 'I told you to set up the string-boards first, and then to make the grooves. 
 'If only I don't disgrace myself before that stranger! If only Oblonsky's shooting does not beat mine!' was his thought. 
 On this side of Gvozdevo there is a good marsh for snipe, and beyond it are splendid snipe marshes, and there are some double-snipe there too. 
 'There is, but it would delay us; and besides, it's hot! 
 'There, you see I was not grudging you the marsh!' said Levin. 'It only meant losing time.' 
 'No, it was enjoyable all the same. You saw?' said Vasenka Veslovsky, climbing awkwardly into the cart with his gun and the peewit. 
 Oblonsky shook his head and laughed reproachfully at Veslovsky. 
 Veslovsky killed the bird and went back to the vehicles. 
 Laska, who had long been whining plaintively, as if complaining of the injustice, rushed straight forward to a likely spot covered with hummocks and known to Levin, where Krak had not yet been. 
 Picking his way, he approached the dog. 
 After making sure he had missed, he turned and saw that the trap and horses were no longer on the road but in the marsh. 
 Veslovsky, wishing to watch the shooting, had driven into the marsh, where the horses had stuck fast. 
 'What the devil brings him here?' muttered Levin to himself, turning back to the vehicle. 'Why did you leave the road?' he asked drily, and calling the coachman, set to work to get the horses out. 
 When they got to the real marsh, the object of their journey, Levin involuntarily wished to rid himself of Vasenka and go about unhindered. 
 Oblonsky evidently wanted the same thing, and on his face Levin noticed the preoccupation, which every true sportsman feels before the shooting begins, and also a little good-natured cunning, characteristic of him. 
 'The marsh begins here, just in front of us: you can see, where it is greener? From there it goes to the right, where those horses are; there are hummocks, and double-snipe; and it goes round that sedge to the alder grove and down to the mill. 
 'Well then, who goes to the left and who to the right?' asked Oblonsky. 'The space on the right is broader, so you two go there together, and I will keep to the left,' he added with affected indifference. 
 We'll make the best bag,' chimed in Vasenka. 
 Levin could not avoid agreeing, and they separated. 
 While they were reloading another bird rose, and Veslovsky, who had finished reloading, fired two charges of small shot over the water. 
 Levin hurried, grew impatient, and became more and more flurried, until at last he fired almost without hope of killing anything. 
 Her search became more and more indolent, and she looked round at the sportsmen as if in perplexity and with reproach. 
 Levin badly wanted a drink of vodka and a bit of bread. He felt faint and could hardly drag his staggering legs out of the bog, and for an instant he was in doubt. 
 Just at his feet rose a snipe; he fired and killed it. 
 'Fetch it!' Another bird rose before the dog. 
 Even without Vasenka, whom he had blamed for his ill-luck, things went no better. Here, too, were plenty of birds, but Levin missed one after another. 
 Feeling refreshed, he returned to the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved not to get flurried. 
 One dog for two people is inconvenient,' said Oblonsky, to soften his triumph. 
 Ils ont été charmants! [They were charming.] 
 What bread – wonderful! Délicieux! 
 And they positively would not take any money, and kept on saying, "No offence!" or something of that sort.' 
 After fluctuating between recollections and stories of the shooting, of dogs, and of other shooting parties, the talk reached a theme that interested all three. 
 'Not at all!' Levin could hear that Oblonsky said this with a smile; 'I simply don't consider him more dishonest than any of the rich merchants or noblemen. 
 [The king is dead, long live the king.] Hardly were the monopolies stopped before railways and banks appeared: other means of acquiring wealth without work.' 
 'Yes, you feel it, but you won't give him your estate,' said Oblonsky, purposely provoking Levin. 
 'I don't give it away because nobody demands that of me, and if I wanted to I could not do it,' replied Levin; 'besides, there is no one to give it to.' 
 'Yes, that is a sophistical explanation,' put in Veslovsky. 'Oh, our host!' he said, addressing a peasant who had opened the creaking barn doors and was entering. 
 She won't bite?' he asked, cautiously stepping with bare feet. 
 It's women's voices singing, and not at all badly. Who is that singing, mine host?' 
 'Well, then I'll go alone,' said Veslovsky, rising quickly and putting on his boots. 
 'I say, hadn't we really better go?' put in Oblonsky, evidently weary of the mental strain. 'We can't go to sleep, you know. 
 'Hasn't the fresh hay a strong scent!' remarked Oblonsky, sitting up. 'Nothing will make me sleep. 
 Ça ne tire pas à consequence!" [It's of no consequence.] 
 The important part is to guard the sanctity of the home! 
 Really, very pretty!' he said in such an approving way, as if she had been made pretty specially for him, and he was satisfied with the maker. 
 He did not wish the sun to rise before he reached the marsh. 
 To decide this she began working round in a circle, when her master's voice disturbed her. 'Laska! 
 He, with his familiar face but ever terrible eyes, came stumbling over the hummocks, but unusually slowly, she thought. 
 Then, just spreading its wings slightly and folding them again, it vanished round a corner with an awkward backward jerk. 
 'Now, things will go right,' thought Levin, putting the warm fat snipe into his bag. 'Eh, Laska dear, will things go right?' 
 'Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!' he shouted, following Levin from afar. 
 And Levin felt increased pleasure in killing three snipe one after another within sight of this little boy, who expressed his approval. 
 I have a new bodyguard – Mary Vlasyevna,' this was the midwife, a new and important personage in the Levins' family life. 
 'She has come to see me and finds me perfectly well, and we have got her to stay till your return. 
 'It was overdriven yesterday, Constantine Dmitrich,' he said. 'Why, it was driven hard for ten versts!' 
 It turned out that there were no pies, nor even any chicken left! 
 'He has an appetite!' said Oblonsky, laughing and pointing to Vasenka Veslovsky. 'I don't suffer from lack of appetite, but he's quite surprising...' 
 'No, this is impossible,' he thought, glancing occasionally at Vasenka, who was leaning toward Kitty and saying something, with his handsome smile, and at Kitty, blushing and agitated. 
 Levin even saw something impure in Kitty's pose and smile; and again the light faded from his eyes. 
 The conversation with Kitty begun by Vasenka again dealt with Anna and with the question whether love can rise above social conditions. 
 But she was too simple and innocent to know how to stop it, or even how to conceal the superficial pleasure which this young man's evident attentions caused her. 
 He went downstairs, but had not had time to leave his study before he heard his wife's familiar footsteps following him with imprudent rapidity. 
 'Only tell me this: was there something improper, impure, degradingly horrid in his tone?' he said, standing in front of her in the same attitude as on that night, with fists pressing his chest. 
 One regrets Miss Elliot a thousand times – this one does not look after the children; she's only a machine... 
 'That proves nothing; it is not a bad tendency but just mischievousness,' Levin comforted her. 
 He told me frankly after tea: "Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à Kitty!" [I believe Veslovsky is courting Kitty a wee bit.] 
 Consider!' she went on, laughing. 'You can go to Fanny now,' she said to Masha. 
 'No, if you like I will tell Steve and he will take him away. 
 'But you will quarrel?' 
 Levin took the broken stick and began pulling off the splintered bits at the end, not knowing how to begin. 
 Probably the sight of those strained arms, those muscles he had felt that morning when doing gymnastics, and the gleaming eyes, low voice and trembling jaws, convinced Vasenka more than the words. 
 'Well, I never expected this of you! On peut être jaloux, mais à ce point c'est du dernier ridicule!' 
 'What does that mean?' wondered Levin when the footman ran out of the house and stopped the vehicle. 
 And then I hear: "Stop!" "Well," think I, "they've relented." 
 At home her care of the children never gave her leisure to think, but now, during this four hours' drive, all the thoughts she had repressed crowded suddenly into her mind, and she reviewed her whole life from all sides as she had never done before. 
 But then questions of the present began to be replaced by those of the immediate future. She began thinking that she would have to move into another house in Moscow for the winter, have the drawing-room furniture re-covered, and a new winter coat made for the eldest girl. 
 'At present I am teaching Grisha, but that is only because I am free now and not having a baby. Of course Steve is not to be counted on, but with the help of kind people I shall start them somehow... 
 But in case of another child...' 
 'I had one girl, but God released me. I buried her in Lent.' 
 In those cynical words there was some truth. 
 'Altogether,' she thought, looking back at the whole of her life during those fifteen years of wedlock, 'pregnancy, sickness, dullness of mind, indifference to everything, and above all disfigurement. 
 Travail, suffering, monstrous suffering, and that final moment... then nursing, sleepless nights, and that awful pain!' 
 Again she remembered what the young woman had said. Again the recollection was repulsive to her, but she could not help admitting that there was a measure of crude truth in the words. 
 I at least have a husband whom I love. Not as I wished to love, but still I do love him; but Anna did not love hers. 
 I don't even now know whether I did well to listen to her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow. 
 The clerk wished to get down, but then, changing his mind, shouted authoritatively and beckoned to a peasant. 
 The breeze, which they had felt while driving, died down when they stopped; and horseflies settled on the sweating horses, which angrily tried to brush them off. 
 When you have passed that bend turn to the left, and go right down the drive and you'll knock up straight against it. 
 'Are they at home, my good man?' said Dolly vaguely, not knowing how to speak of Anna even to a peasant. 
 Here they are themselves!' cried the man, pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a char-a-banc coming along the road. 
 'It's what I thought, but dared not expect! What a pleasure! 
 You cannot imagine how delighted I am!' she cried, now pressing her face to Dolly's and kissing her, now leaning back to gaze smilingly at her. 
 'What joy, Alexis!' she said, turning to Vronsky, who had dismounted and was walking toward them. 
 Dolly walked up to the char-a-banc and coldly greeted Princess Barbara. 
 The clerk, to hide his embarrassment, bustled about, helping the ladies in, but Philip became morose and made up his mind not to be imposed upon by this eternal superiority. 
 'What chance of a sleep to-day?' said the old man blinking at the sun. 'It's too late! 
 Well, what do you think? I am ashamed to confess it, but I... 
 Dolly wanted to tell Anna what she had been thinking that morning, but for some reason it now seemed out of place. 
 'However, we will talk about all that later. What is this? 
 'I don't take any view. I always loved you, and if one loves, one loves the whole person as he or she is, and not as one might wish them to be.' 
 What a lot of them there are!' said she after a moment's silence, repeating her question. 
 He is not only not bored, but passionately engrossed in his occupations. 
 'How fine!' said Dolly, looking with involuntary surprise at a handsome house with a row of columns standing out among the variously tinted foliage of the old trees in the garden. 
 'Ah, they've already arrived,' said Anna, looking at the horses that were being led away from the front door. 
 Where is the Count?' she asked the two elegant footmen who had rushed out. 'Ah, there he is!' she went on, seeing Vronsky and Veslovsky coming out to meet her. 
 The corner room will be better, we shall see more of one another there. 
 'Pardon! J'en ai tout plein les poches,' [Pardon me, my pockets are full of it.] he answered with a smile, plunging his fingers into his waistcoat pocket. 
 That's impossible.' 'I have promised... and the children,' answered Dolly, feeling embarrassed because she had to get her bag out of the calèche and because she knew her face was covered with dust. 
 And this room needing an apology was full of luxuries, such as Dolly had never lived among, which reminded her of the best hotels abroad. 
 'Well, dearest! How happy I am!' said Anna, who in her riding-habit had sat down for a moment beside Dolly. 
 But really, dear, I am so glad to see you,' said Anna, kissing her again. 'You have not yet told me how and what you think about me, and I want to know everything. 
 However, that needs a long talk, and we will talk it all well over later. 
 At home it was clear that six jackets required twenty-four arshins of nainsook at sixty-five kopeks, which comes to more than fifteen roubles, besides the trimmings and the work; and she had saved all that. 
 But before the maid she felt not exactly ashamed but uncomfortable. 
 She knew what such simplicity meant and cost. 
 Here were perambulators ordered from England, an apparatus to teach a baby to walk, a specially constructed piece of furniture like a billiard-table for the baby to crawl on, swings, and baths of a new special kind. 
 A Russian nursemaid was feeding the child and evidently herself eating also. 
 Besides that, from a few words she heard, Dolly at once understood that Anna, the wet nurse, the head nurse, and the baby did not get on with one another, and that the mother's appearance was not a usual occurrence. 
 'Her husband will give her a divorce, and then I shall go back to my solitude; but at present I can be of use and I fulfil my duty, however hard it may be, not like others... And how kind you are, and how well you have done to come! 
 Think of Biryuzovsky and Avenyeva... And even Nikandrov! 
 And how about Vasilev with Mamanova, and Lisa Neptunova... ? No one said anything against them? 
 Quite in the English style. We assemble for breakfast, and then we separate.] 
 There were a great many ways of spending time at Vozdvizhensk, all differing from those at Pokrovsk. 
 'No, it's too hot: better let's walk through the garden and go for a row, to let Darya Alexandrovna see the banks,' suggested Vronsky. 
 She experienced the same kind of shyness in his presence that she had felt when the lady's maid saw her jacket. 
 'C'est devenu tellement commun, les écoles,' [Schools have become so common.] answered Vronsky. 'Of course that's not the reason, but I... 
 Beside the finished building another as yet surrounded by scaffolding was being built. Workmen wearing aprons stood on the scaffolding laying bricks, pouring water from wooden pails, or smoothing the mortar. 
 'Yes, I am very much interested in it,' said Anna to Sviyazhsky, who expressed surprise at her knowledge of architecture. 
 Having finished talking with the architect Vronsky rejoined the ladies and led them to the hospital. 
 Dolly was simply surprised at what she had never before seen, and wishing to understand it all, asked for information about every detail, which evidently gratified Vronsky. 
 Alone with him she suddenly felt frightened: his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her. 
 I see that Anna is happy, quite happy, she has already told me so,' said Dolly smiling; and involuntarily while saying it she doubted whether Anna was really happy. 
 Whether we acted rightly or wrongly is another question; the die is cast,' he said, changing from Russian into French, 'and we are bound together for life. 
 Yet the law and the circumstances of our position are such that thousands of complications appear which at present, while resting after all her sufferings and trials, she neither sees nor wishes to see. 
 Imagine the situation of a man who knows in advance that children born of him and of the woman he loves will not be his, but some one else's – some one who will hate them and will have nothing to do with them! 
 Even to be able to petition the Emperor for permission to adopt the child, a divorce will be necessary, and that depends on Anna. 
 [One must act out all these refinements of sentiment. The happiness and existence of Anna and her children depend on it.] 
 But how is it she herself does not think of it?' asked Dolly, suddenly remembering that strange new habit Anna had of screwing up her eyes. And she remembered that it was just when the intimate side of life was in question that Anna screwed up her eyes. 
 FINDING DOLLY ALREADY RETURNED, Anna looked attentively into her eyes as if asking about the talk she had had with Vronsky, but she did not ask in words. 
 'I think it's nearly dinner-time,' she said. 'We have not yet seen anything of one another... 
 'Yes, we are very formal here,' Anna remarked, as if excusing her own smartness. 'Alexis is seldom so pleased about anything as he is at your having come. 
 The fat butler – his round, clean-shaven face and starched white tie shining – announced dinner. 
 'It is pleasant to work with his Excellency,' answered the architect with a smile. He was a dignified, respectful and quiet man. 
 'It is not like having to do with the Local Authorities,' said he. 'Where they would scribble over a whole ream of paper, I merely report to the Count; we talk it over, and three words settle the matter.' 
 She was obviously aware that her explanation would not be understood, but as she knew that she spoke pleasantly and that her hands were beautiful, she went on explaining. 
 'Es kommt darauf an... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden, [It all depends... 
 The price of the wire must be allowed for.] and the German, drawn from his silence, turned to Vronsky. 'Das lässt sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht!' 
 'And we thought we should find you on the field, Vasily Semenich! Were you there?' she said to the doctor, a sickly-looking man. 
 'What a pity!' said Anna, and having thus paid the tribute of politeness to the retainers, she turned to her friends. 
 Once Dolly was stung to the quick; and so aroused that she even flushed up, and afterwards wondered whether she had said anything superfluous and disagreeable. 
 'I cannot defend his opinions,' said Dolly, flaring up, 'but I can say that he is a very well-informed man, and if he were here he would be able to answer you, though I cannot.' 
 [But, excuse me, he is a little cracked.] For instance, he maintains that the Zemstvos and Magistrates are quite unnecessary, and he won't have anything to do with them.' 
 'I know no one who fulfils his duties more strictly,' said Dolly, irritated by Vronsky's superior tone. 
 I consider that the duty of going to the meetings, and considering a peasant's case about a horse, is as important as anything else I can do. 
 To Dolly it sounded strange to hear how assured he was of being in the right, here at his own table. 
 She remembered how Levin, who held the opposite opinion, was equally positive in his opinions at his own table. 
 'And I rather agree with your brother-in-law,' said Anna, 'though I do not go to his lengths,' she added with a smile. 'I'm afraid we have too many of these public obligations nowadays. 
 Alexis has not been here six months, and I think he is already a member of five or six different institutions: Guardian of the Poor, Justice of the Peace, a Member of a Council, a juryman, and Member of some Commission on Horses... 
 Du train que cela va,' [At the rate at which it is going.] all his time will be taken up that way. 
 Although Anna spoke playfully, irritation was perceptible in her tone. 
 But not to disturb the others and to while away the time, after resting she rejoined the players and pretended to like it. 
 Those painful maternal worries, which she had so hated on her journey, now after a day spent without them appeared in quite a different light and drew her back to them. 
 'It is not enough to say he's a fine fellow; I do not know a better man.' 
 I am very glad! It is not enough to say he's a fine fellow,' she repeated. 
 Dolly did not know what to call him. 
 But we came here in early spring and lived quite alone, and we shall live alone again. I don't wish for anything better. 
 She smiled. 'Well then, what did he talk about to you?' 
 Au fond c'est la femme la plus dépravée qui existe. [At bottom, she's the most depraved woman in existence.] 
 She had a liaison with Tushkevich, deceiving her husband in the worst way, and she told me that she did not wish to know me as long as my position was irregular...! 
 'He said that he suffers on your account and on his own. 
 'But the chief thing he wants is that you should not suffer.' 
 'After my illness the doctor told me...' 
 It was the very thing she had dreamt of, but now on learning that it was possible, she was horrified. 
 Anna noticed the sigh, which expressed dissent, and continued. 
 These were the very arguments Dolly had put to herself, but now she listened without understanding them. 'How can one be guilty toward beings who don't exist?' thought she. 
 The question for you is, whether you desire not to have any more children; for me it is, whether I desire to have them. 
 'Yes, to tell you the truth, I don't like Veslovsky's manner,' said Dolly, wishing to change the subject. 
 It tickles Alexis, and that's all; he is only a boy and entirely in my hands; you know, I manage him just as I please. 
 I not consider that!' she repeated, and flushed. 
 Dolly, sitting upright in her chair, with a pained expression of sympathy turned her head to follow Anna's movements. 
 Anna at that instant had reached the other end of the room and stopped there, doing something to the window curtain. 'I receive his consent, and my so... son? 
 Understand that I love equally, I think, and both more than myself – two beings: Serezha and Alexis.' 
 She bent her head and, trembling all over with emotion, looked from under her brows with moist, glittering eyes at the thin, piteous-looking little Dolly in her patched dressing-jacket and night-cap. 
 If anyone is unhappy, it is I!' she murmured, and, turning away, she wept. 
 Recollections of home and of her children rose in her imagination with a new and peculiar charm. 
 But in her expression of restrained excitement, which concealed something, he detected nothing except that beauty which, though familiar, still captivated him, her consciousness of this, and her desire that it should act on him. 
 When they had driven into the fields Dolly experienced a pleasant feeling of relief, and she was about to ask the men how they had liked the Vronskys' place, when suddenly Philip the coachman himself remarked: 
 But it did seem so dull to me, Darya Alexandrovna! I don't know how you found it,' he added, turning his handsome, kindly face toward her. 
 Their life seemed one that could not be improved upon: they had ample means, good health, a child, and both had occupations of their own. 
 Where it was a question of income – the sale of forest land, of corn or wool, or the leasing of land – Vronsky was as hard as flint and could hold out for his price. 
 It was the first time since their union that he had parted from her without a full explanation. 
 Levin had also some very important business to attend to in Kashin for his sister who lived abroad. It was in connection with a wardship and the receiving of money due to her for land transferred to the peasants. 
 This legal adviser seemed to do all that was possible and to strain every nerve to get Levin out of his difficulties. 
 And the adviser would make an elaborate plan to circumvent the fatal difficulty which was at the root of all this trouble. But he would immediately add: 'All the same you will be put off; however, have a try!' 
 It was specially annoying to Levin to be quite unable to understand with whom he was contending, and whom the delay in his business could profit. 
 He always sided with the Nobility in everything, openly opposed the spread of popular education, and gave a class character to the Zemstvo, which should have such enormous importance. 
 To replace Snetkov as Marshal, Sviyazhsky was proposed, or, better still, Nevedovsky, an ex-professor, a remarkably intelligent man, and a great friend of Koznyshev's. 
 Having finished his speech the Governor left the hall, and the noblemen, noisily, vivaciously, some of them even rapturously, followed him out with enthusiasm, and stood around him as he was putting on his fur coat and talking in a friendly way with the Marshal of the Province. 
 Men who had long not met – some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, and some from abroad – came together in those halls. 
 The old, for the most part, either wore old-fashioned buttoned-up uniforms of their class and carried swords and hats, or wore the naval, cavalry, or infantry uniforms to which each was individually entitled. 
 Some of the young ones, as Levin observed, belonged to the old party, and on the other hand some very aged noblemen conversed in whispers with Sviyazhsky and evidently were warm partisans of the new party. 
 Hlyustov was unwilling to go with the members for his district to invite Snetkov to stand again for election. Sviyazhsky was persuading him to do so and Koznyshev approved of this. 
 'We are holding the position, Sergius Ivanich!' said he, smoothing back his whiskers. 
 'One district is sufficient, and Sviyazhsky evidently belongs to the Opposition,' he said, and every one but Levin understood him. 
 No authorization! Flerov is not admitted! 
 The looks and expressions on the faces were yet more spiteful and furious than the words. They expressed implacable hatred. 
 But Levin had forgotten that, and it pained him to see these good men, whom he respected, in such an unpleasant, malevolent state of excitement. 
 'Please come, Constantine Dmitrich!' said he. 'Your brother is looking for you. 
 The debate about Flerov had given the new party not merely his vote but also a gain in time, so that they had had a chance to bring up three more nobles who, by the machinations of the old party, were to be prevented from taking part in the election. 
 'I have brought one. I soused him,' said the landowner who had been to fetch him, approaching Sviyazhsky. 
 The others, like the rank and file before a battle, though preparing for the fight, sought distraction meanwhile. 
 Levin had noticed him at the elections the day before and had carefully avoided meeting him. 
 I told him not to! 
 I snap my fingers at him and his princely title! 
 'Oh, still the same – with a loss,' replied the landowner as he stopped beside Levin, with a resigned smile and a look of calm conviction that it must be so. 
 'And how do you come to be in our Province?' he asked. 'Have you come to take part in our coup d'état?' he went on, pronouncing the French words firmly but badly. 
 It's a sort of moral obligation. 
 It can't be grown in a year,' he remarked cautiously, immediately changing the subject. 'Well, and how is your husbandry getting on?' 
 It is clear he will be a scholar, so that there will be no one to continue my work, and yet I go on! 
 'And he will make a fortune, while you and I must be thankful if we can keep what we have and leave it to our children.' 
 'Yes, it is curious,' he continued. 'We live without gaining anything, as if we were appointed, like the vestals of old, to guard some fire or other.' 
 'But why don't we do like the merchant? Why don't we cut down our limes for bast?' said Levin, returning to the thought that had struck him. 
 'Why, as you have said, we guard the fire! 
 Our work is not done here, at the elections, but at our homes. 
 We have a class instinct as to what should not be done. 
 I see it in the peasants too sometimes: a proper peasant always tries to get hold of as much land as possible. 
 'Just like us,' said Levin. 'Very, very glad to have met you,' he added, seeing Sviyazhsky approaching. 
 'Yes, I well remember our meeting,' said Levin, and blushing scarlet immediately turned and spoke to his brother. 
 He must either decline or accept,' replied Sviyazhsky. 
 'That's just it: neither the one nor the other,' answered Vronsky. 
 'Well, has it touched you to the quick too?' said Oblonsky, winking at Vronsky. 'It's like the races. 
 It makes one inclined to bet on the result.' 
 'What a capable man Sviyazhsky is! How clearly he puts everything!' 
 I have not had a single case in eight years, and when I did have one it was decided wrongly. 
 The Marshal of the Province is our opponent, and you are ami cochon [You are quite thick with him.] with him and ask him to stand. 
 But Count Vronsky... I do not make a friend of him; he invited me to dinner and I shan't go; but he is one of our party, so why make an enemy of him? 
 The Marshal of the Province, though he felt in the air that there was a plot prepared against him, and though he had not been unanimously asked to stand, had still decided to do so. 
 There was silence in the hall, and the Secretary loudly announced that Michael Stepanich Snetkov, Captain of the Guards, was nominated for the post of Provincial Marshal, and that the ballot would now be taken. 
 An expert standing beside the box, who by the mere motion of an elbow could tell where every ball was put, made a wry face. 
 Sviyazhsky smilingly answered for Koznyshev. 'The other candidate may get still more votes.' 
 At first he was surprised and wanted to understand what it meant; then, coming to the conclusion that he could not understand it, he grew bored. 
 'I said you would be in time,' the Assistant said, as Levin stepped aside to let the lady pass. 
 Levin was already descending the stairs to the exit and getting out his cloakroom ticket when the Secretary caught him. 'Please come, Constantine Dmitrich! 
 The candidate who was standing was Nevedovsky, who had so decidedly declined. 
 'Oh, Lord!' said the Marshal of the Province with a deep sigh; and with his weary legs in the white trousers dragging, and hanging his head, he went down the middle of the hall to the chief table. 
 Nevedovsky had a majority as they had expected and he was now Marshal of the Province. 
 But he had not at all expected that the election business would interest him so much and so touch him to the quick, or that he could do it so well. 
 He saw clearly, and others acknowledged, that he had contributed very much to Nevedovsky's success. 
 Now, at his own table, celebrating Nevedovsky's election, Vronsky experienced a pleasant feeling of triumph. 
 Oblonsky too was pleased that he had spent his time merrily and that every one was satisfied. 
 During the dinner several telegrams were sent to persons interested in the elections. 
 He dictated it aloud, saying, 'I must cheer them up!' But Dolly, on receiving the telegram, only sighed over the rouble it had cost, and understood that it had been sent toward the end of a dinner. 
 She knew that Steve had a weakness at the end of a dinner-party faire jouer le télégraphe. [To set the telegraph going.] 
 The contents of the letter were just what he expected, but its form was unexpected and particularly unpleasant to him. 'Annie is very ill. 
 I lose my head when alone. The Princess Barbara is not a help but a hindrance. 
 Though she was convinced that this was the case, she could not do anything, could not in any way change her relation to him. 
 She began to wish for this, and decided to agree the first time he or Steve should mention it to her. 
 With these thoughts in her mind she spent five days, the days she expected him to be away. 
 Anna nursed her, but this did not divert her thoughts especially as the illness was not dangerous. 
 She remembered that the child had been quite well since yesterday. She was even vexed with her for having recovered as soon as the letter had been sent. 
 'Well, I'm very glad,' he said, coldly surveying her coiffure and the dress which, he knew, she had put on for him. 
 And you are well?' said he, wiping his wet beard with his handkerchief, and kissing her hand. 
 'It was such a strange letter. Annie was ill, yet you wished to come yourself!' 
 I am only displeased, really, that you seem not to wish to admit that there are duties...' 
 'I only wished to say that one may have unavoidable business. 
 But not a cold look only but the angry look of a hunted and exasperated man flashed in his eyes as he spoke those tender words. 
 It was a momentary impression, but she never forgot it. 
 But she understood him not from without but from within and saw that in town he was not himself; she could not otherwise define his condition. 
 She knew now what consorting with gay people of Oblonsky's sort meant – it meant drinking and then driving somewhere... 
 And he also complained that he had talked too much about his book here, so that all his ideas had become confused and he had lost interest in them. 
 The one advantage of this town-life was that here they never quarrelled. 
 'WELL THEN, PLEASE CALL ON THE BOLS,' said Kitty to her husband when, at about eleven o'clock in the morning he came to her room before going out. 'I know you are dining at the club. 
 Papa put your name down. But what are you going to do this morning?' 
 'Oh yes, do go! They are giving those new pieces... 
 'Well, will you believe it? I have got so out of the habit that it makes me feel ashamed. 
 A stranger arrives, sits down, remains a while doing nothing, disturbs them, upsets himself, and goes away again.' 
 'No, wait a moment.' She held him by the hand. 
 Not once since our marriage have I said to myself that things might have been better than they are...' 
 Oh, yes! Do you know, Dolly's situation is becoming quite impossible! 
 Mama and I were talking about it with Arseny' (so she called her sister's, the Princess Lvova's, husband), 'and we decided to set you and him at Steve. 
 The notes he now changed no longer evoked such calculations, but flew away like wee birds. 
 Whether the pleasure afforded by what it purchased corresponded to the labour expended in acquiring the money was a consideration long since lost sight of. 
 His farming calculations that there is a price below which certain grain must not be sold were forgotten too. 
 While driving he thought of Katavasov and of making Metrov's acquaintance. 
 Katavasov in a few words told him the latest news, and, taking him into the study, introduced Levin to a tall, sturdy, and very agreeable-looking man. 
 Levin tried to imagine a situation in which both utterances might have been made, and the subject was dropped. 
 'I really began to write a book on agriculture, but being occupied with the chief instrument in agriculture, the labourer,' said Levin with a blush, 'I involuntarily arrived at quite unexpected results.' And Levin began carefully, as if feeling his way, to expound his views. 
 But afterwards, having convinced himself that they looked at the question so differently that they would never understand one another, he ceased making objections and merely listened. 
 'Oh no, it is still so unfinished! 
 At the table covered with a cloth at which Katavasov and Metrov took their seats six men were sitting, and one of them, with his head bent close over a manuscript, was reading something. 
 In this connection Metrov told the chairman the same thing that he had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks as he had made in the morning, but for the sake of diversity expressed also a new view of his own – which had but just entered his head. 
 And I was just going to send to you. Well, and how is Kitty? 
 He rose and pushed forward a rocking-chair. 'Have you read the last circular in the Journal de St Petersbourg? 
 'It's true I have no time to spare, my work and occupation with the children deprive me of that; besides, I am not ashamed to confess that my education was far too insufficient.' 
 'All I know is that I never saw better brought up children than yours,' said Levin, 'and do not wish for better children.' 
 Lvov evidently tried to restrain the expression of his delight, but a radiant smile lit up his face. 
 That is all I desire. You do not yet know all the difficulties one has with boys who, like mine, have been neglected through our life abroad,' said he. 
 He carefully avoided the musical experts and great talkers, and stood with lowered eyes gazing straight before him, listening. 
 Wishing to clear up his own perplexity by hearing other people's impressions, Levin went to look for the experts, and was pleased to find a celebrated one chatting with his own acquaintance, Pestsov. 
 'How do you do, Constantine Dmitrich?... Especially shapely, plastic, and rich in colour, if one may say so, is the passage where you feel the approach of Cordelia, the woman, das ewige Weibliche, [The eternal feminine.] and she enters upon a struggle with fate.' 
 'You can't follow without it,' said Pestsov turning to Levin, as the man he had been talking to had gone away and he had no one else to talk to. 
 'Well then, go at once,' said the Princess Lvova, to whom he mentioned the matter. 
 'Yes, I have heard... 
 There was a pause, and the mother exchanged glances with her daughter. 
 The ladies shook hands with him and asked him to tell his wife mille choses [To give his wife their love.] from them. 
 Levin again expressed, and heard, various opinions about the meeting, the new fantasia, and a trial. 
 But probably as a result of the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made a slip when talking of the trial, and he afterwards remembered that slip with vexation several times. 
 He remembered the club and the external details of its rooms, but had quite forgotten the impression it then made upon him. 
 Here and there he came across all sorts of people he knew: old and young, some whom he only just knew and some with whom he was intimate. 
 'She's all right: they are all three dining together.' 
 'Have you just come?' asked Oblonsky, hastening toward them. 
 Then they talked about horses, about that day's races, and how gallantly Vronsky's Atlasny had won the first prize. 
 Levin hardly noticed how the dinner passed. 
 'No; my father did, and I remember them and know something about them.' 
 Well, an egg that has been rolled very often becomes a shlyupik. [A hard-boiled egg that has been repeatedly cracked till it has become soft and useless for the game.] 
 Yes, my lad! That's how it is!' 
 Levin sat down for a while and listened, but remembering all the conversations he had that day heard, he suddenly felt terribly bored. 
 'She is not exactly dull, but that indefinite, unsettled position...' Levin overheard, and was hastening away when Oblonsky called him. 
 To-day it was both. 'Levin, don't go,' he said, holding him tightly by the elbow, evidently not wishing to let him go on any account. 
 But in spite of Oblonsky's wish and theirs they had nothing to say to one another, and both knew it. 
 'Place the balls for pyramids,' he added, turning to the billiard-marker. 
 He was glad the hostility between Vronsky and himself was ended, and the impression of tranquillity, decorum, and pleasure did not leave him. 
 But Oblonsky would not let him reflect, and as if guessing his doubts tried to dispel them. 
 Though she is my sister,' Oblonsky continued, 'I may safely say that she is a remarkable woman. 
 But she... you'll see how she has arranged her life, how quiet and dignified she is!... 
 'I think you see in every woman only a female, une couveuse! [A broody hen.] necessarily occupied with children if at all!' said Oblonsky. 
 Passing through a small dining-room, panelled in dark wood, Oblonsky and Levin entered the study across the soft carpet. It was lit by a lamp with a large dark shade. 
 While Oblonsky passed behind a screen of trellis-work – and the man's voice that had been speaking became silent – Levin looked at the portrait, which in the bright illumination seemed to step out of its frame, and he could not tear himself away from it. 
 I only knew her for a very short time, but she left on me the impression of a lovely flower... just a flower! And she will soon be a mother!' 
 She spoke easily and without haste, occasionally turning her eyes from Levin to her brother. 
 'Isn't it wonderfully good?' said Oblonsky, noticing that Levin kept looking at the portrait. 
 'She was here yesterday. She is very angry with the High School because of Grisha. 
 Levin did not now speak at all in the matter-of-fact way in which he had talked that morning. 
 Anna not only talked naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and carelessly, not attributing any value to her own ideas, but attributing great value to those of her interlocutor. 
 Levin said the French had carried conventionality in art further than anyone else, and therefore attributed special merit to a return to realism. 
 Anna's face brightened all over when she suddenly appreciated the remark. She laughed. 
 What you have said quite characterizes present-day French art, painting and even literature: Zola, Daudet. 
 'What a woman!' thought Levin, and, quite forgetting himself, he gazed fixedly at her beautiful mobile face, which had now suddenly quite changed. 
 And her smile and glance told him that she was speaking for him alone, valuing his opinion and knowing in advance that they would understand one another. 
 After a pause she smiled and said, 'Yes, yes, I never could do it. Je n'ai pas le coeur assez large [My heart is not big enough] to love a whole orphanage-full of unpleasant little girls. 
 And now especially,' she went on with a sad, confiding expression, as though addressing her brother but evidently speaking to Levin, 'now when I so need some occupation, I can't do it!' 
 Levin again looked at the portrait and at her figure as, arm-in-arm with her brother, she passed through the lofty doorway, and he felt a tenderness and pity for her which surprised him. 
 She asked Levin and Vorkuyev to pass on into the drawing-room, and herself remained behind to speak to her brother. 'About the divorce? 
 'Good-bye!' she said, retaining his hand and gazing at him with a look that drew him to her. 'I am very pleased que la glace est rompue.' 
 Didn't I tell you?' said Oblonsky, who saw that Levin had been entirely vanquished. 
 And resolving that he would attend to it next day without fail, he went to his wife. On his way he ran over in his mind the whole of the past day. 
 All the events had consisted of conversations: conversations to which he had listened or in which he had taken part. All these conversations were about matters he would never have occupied himself with had he been in the country, but here they were very interesting. 
 But, not to hinder his relating everything, she masked her observation and listened with an appreciative smile while he told her how he had spent the evening. 
 You see, I shall now try to avoid meeting him again, but the constraint will no longer exist...' said he, and remembering that whilst 'trying to avoid meeting him again' he had gone straight to Anna's, he blushed. 'There now! 
 I restrain myself, wait, invent occupations for myself, – the English family, writing, reading, but all that is only deception, it is all a kind of morphia. 
 He ought to pity me,' said she, feeling tears of self-compassion rising to her eyes. 
 She did not want strife and blamed him for wanting to fight, but yet she involuntarily took up a fighting attitude. 
 Her look was cold and hostile. 'You told Steve you were staying to bring Yashvin away, but you have left him.' 
 'For one thing, I did not give him any message for you; and for another I never say what is not true. But chiefly, I wanted to stay, so I stayed,' he replied with a frown. 
 For you it is a question whether you will conquer me, and for me...' Again she felt sorry for herself and nearly burst into tears. 
 'If you only knew what it means to me! When I feel as I do now, that you are hostile toward me – hostile is the right word – if you only knew what that means to me! 
 If you knew how near I am to a catastrophe at such moments... how afraid I am! Afraid of myself!' 
 You haven't told me about them,' and she tried to hide her triumph at her victory, for the victory was hers after all. 
 'Nothing,' said she, coming candle in hand from beyond the partition. 'I only felt a little unwell,' she added with a peculiarly sweet and significant smile. 
 'We must send...' And he began to dress hurriedly. 
 Only afterwards he remembered that bated breath, and realized all that had passed in her dear sweet soul while she lay motionless by his side, awaiting the greatest event of a woman's life. 
 She looked at him smilingly, but suddenly her eyebrows twitched, she raised her head, and coming quickly to him she took hold of his hand and clinging close she enveloped him in her hot breath. 
 She suffered, complained, triumphed in her sufferings, rejoiced in them and loved them. 
 Oh yes, to Dolly!' 
 In the little sledge sat Mary Vlasevna in a velvet cloak with a shawl over her head. 'Thank God!' he muttered, recognizing with delight her little blonde face, which now wore a particularly serious and even severe expression. 
 THE DOCTOR WAS NOT YET UP, and his footman said he had gone to bed late and given orders that he was not to be called, but the footman added that he would be up soon. 
 At the chemist's a skinny dispenser, with the same indifference with which the footman had cleaned his lamp-glasses, closed with a wafer a packet of powders for which a coachman was waiting, and refused to let Levin have any opium. 
 The doctor was not up yet, and the footman, now busy putting down a carpet, refused to wake him. 
 The footman consented and went upstairs, asking Levin to step into the waiting-room. 
 Some three minutes elapsed; to Levin they seemed more than an hour. 
 Peter Dmitrich!' he called out in a tone of entreaty through the open door. 'For heaven's sake forgive me!... 
 Levin again began in a piteous voice, but at that instant the doctor came out, dressed and with his hair brushed. 'These people have no conscience,' thought Levin. 
 'Good morning!' said the doctor, holding out his hand and, as it seemed to Levin, teasing him by his calm manner. 
 Trying to be as exact as possible, Levin began recounting every unnecessary detail of his wife's position, continually interrupting himself to beg the doctor to accompany him at once. 
 Levin gave the doctor a look which asked whether he was not laughing at him. 
 'I know, I know,' he said with a smile. 'I am a family man myself. 
 We husbands are the most miserable of creatures at those times. I have a patient whose husband always runs away into the stable on such occasions!' 
 Levin got home just as the Princess arrived, and they met at the bedroom door. 
 He saw the Princess red, overwrought, her grey hair out of curl, and with tears which she energetically swallowed, biting her lips. 
 The Princess was one moment in the bedroom with the doctor, and the next in the study, where a table laid for a meal had made its appearance; and next it was not the Princess, but Dolly. 
 Afterwards Levin remembered being sent somewhere. 
 But seeing her meek smiling face and hearing her say, 'I have worn you out,' he blamed God; but the thought of God made him at once pray for forgiveness and mercy. 
 Dolly had just entered the study and suggested that the doctor should lie down. 
 It was an interval of rest and oblivion. 
 She looked pale and stern, and as resolute as before though her jaw trembled a little and her eyes were fixed intently on Kitty. 
 Kitty's burning face, worn with suffering, with a lock of hair clinging to her clammy forehead, was turned toward him trying to catch his eye. 
 I am not afraid, I am not afraid!' she said rapidly. 'Mama! 
 'It's all right, it's all right! All goes well!' 
 'It's coming to an end,' said the doctor, with a face so serious that Levin thought that end meant death. 
 In its place was something terrible, both because of its strained expression and because of the sounds which proceeded from it. 
 With her arms helplessly outstretched upon the quilt, unusually beautiful and calm she lay, gazing silently at him, trying unsuccessfully to smile. 
 The taut strings snapped, and sobs and tears of joy that he had not in the least anticipated arose within him, with such force that they shook his whole body and long prevented his speaking. 
 It was a bold, insolent voice that had no consideration for anything, it was the cry of the new human being who had so incomprehensibly appeared from some unknown realm. 
 TOWARD TEN O'CLOCK the old Prince, Koznyshev, and Oblonsky were with Levin, and having talked about the young mother they had begun discussing other matters. 
 That feminine world which since his marriage had received a new and unsuspected significance for him now rose so high in his estimation that his imagination could not grasp it. 
 That look, already bright, grew still brighter as he approached. 
 'Well then, we'll let Papa have a look,' said Mary Vlasevna, lifting something red, strange, and quivering and bringing it nearer. 
 And Mary Vlasevna held out to Levin on one hand (the other merely supporting the nape of the shaky head) this strange, limp, red creature, that hid its head in its swaddling clothes. 
 'Now look at him,' said Kitty, turning him so that Levin could see him. 
 Petrov, the Bank director, got Rs.12,ooo. 
 The post carried a salary of from seven to ten thousand roubles a year, and Oblonsky could hold it without resigning his official position. 
 It depended on two Ministers, one lady, and two Jews; and though they had already been prepared it was necessary for Oblonsky to see all these people in Petersburg. 
 So, having got fifty roubles from Dolly, he went to Petersburg. 
 Turning over the beautifully written, very broad-margined manuscript, Karenin re-read the convincing passage: 
 It's a live business, anyway.' 
 This is an abuse important in itself, which has a bad effect on the State service. 
 'Bolgarinov quite agrees, as far as he is concerned,' returned Oblonsky with a blush. He blushed at the mention of Bolgarinov, because he had that morning been to see the Jew and the visit had left an unpleasant impression on his mind. 
 'NOW THERE'S ANOTHER MATTER; you know what it is... about Anna,' said Oblonsky after a short pause, when he had shaken off the unpleasant recollection. 
 Directly Oblonsky mentioned Anna's name Karenin's face entirely changed. Instead of its former animation it expressed weariness and lifelessness.. 
 'For heaven's sake don't excite yourself,' said Oblonsky, touching his brother-in-law's knee. 'The matter is not closed. 
 'Anna Arkadyevna's life cannot interest me,' interposed Karenin, lifting his brows. 
 She knows that and does not ask you for anything. She says plainly that she dare not ask anything. 
 But I, and all her relatives, who all love her, beg and implore you! 
 Besides, I hoped that Anna Arkadyevna would have generosity enough...' uttered Karenin with difficulty, his lips trembling and his face turning pale. 
 Why, it's like keeping a man condemned to death with the halter round his neck for months, promising him either death or a reprieve! 
 Vous professez d'être un libre penseur, [You profess to be a freethinker.] but I, as a believer, in so important a matter cannot act contrary to the Christian law.' 
 You yourself said "Give your coat when they would take your cloak..."! And now...' 
 Why, I thought it was the Director of the Department!' and he remembered that Anna had asked him to see the boy. 
 He had understood what 'If it is possible' meant. It meant, if it is possible to arrange the divorce so that she should have her son... 
 'He was very ill after that unexpected interview with his mother,' remarked Karenin. 'We even feared for his life. 
 He bowed to his uncle as to a stranger, but recognizing him he blushed and turned away from him quickly as if offended and angry about something. 
 The boy came up to his father and handed him his school report. 
 'He has grown thin and tall, and is no longer a child but a regular boy,' said Oblonsky. 'I like it. 
 'I do, mon oncle,' he answered, looking at his uncle and then again lowering his eyes. 
 'Well, how are things?' said he, wishing to start a conversation, but not knowing what to say. 
 He felt uncomfortable at meeting his uncle, who resembled his mother, because it awakened those very memories which he considered shameful. 
 'Yes, that's no joke,' said Oblonsky, looking sadly into those animated eyes so like the mother's – an infant's eyes no longer, and no longer altogether innocent. 
 'I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?' said the tutor. 'I told you it was a dangerous game. 
 'If I had hurt myself no one would have known it, that is quite certain!' 
 Though the first family was all right, Prince Chechensky felt happier with the second family. 
 He took his eldest son to visit the second family, and told Oblonsky that he considered it developed his son and was good for him. 
 Here people understood that a man must live his own life like a civilized being. 
 Bartnyansky, who spent at least fifty thousand roubles a year at the rate he was living, had the day before made a notable remark to him on the point. 
 'Never mind the name, I shouldn't remember it!… But why do you want to mix in those railway concerns, with Jews?... 
 Oblonsky knew this to be true, not only from hearsay but from actual fact. 
 Count Krivtsov, whose case had long been considered hopeless, still kept two mistresses. 
 In Moscow he sometimes noticed some grey hairs; fell asleep after dinner; stretched himself; walked slowly upstairs, breathing heavily; felt dull among young women, and did not dance at balls. 
 I returned to Russia and had to be with my wife, and in the country besides, and in a fortnight I took to a dressing-gown and gave up dressing for dinner! 
 And as to thinking about young women!... 
 Princess Myagkaya began joyfully. 'They will ask Landau and see what he says.' 
 See what comes of living in the provinces: you know nothing! 
 Afterwards, Yury Meledinsky's wife (the invalid's wife, you know) heard of that Landau, and took him to see her husband. 
 He cured the Countess Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy to him that she adopted him.' 
 Landau hurriedly looked round, approached smilingly, laid upon Oblonsky's outstretched hand his own moist and motionless one, went back, and continued looking at the portraits. 
 'I am very pleased to see you, especially to-day,' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, pointing to a seat beside Karenin. 
 After a momentary pause the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, as if coming to the important point, turned with a subtle smile to Oblonsky. 
 'I have known you a long time, and am very pleased to know you more intimately. Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis. 
 Noticing the looks directed toward him, he smiled a childishly naive smile. 
 'No, not yet, I think,' said Lydia Ivanovna, who was watching the Frenchman's movements. 
 'Yes, but faith without works is dead,' said Oblonsky, recalling that sentence from the catechism, and only by a smile maintaining his independence. 
 'To labour for God with works; to save one's soul by fasting,' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna with fastidious disdain, 'those are the barbarous opinions of our monks... 
 'Vous comprenez l'anglais?' [You understand English?] asked Lydia Ivanovna and having received an affirmative answer she rose and began looking among the books on a shelf. 
 'I want to read Safe and Happy, or, Under the Wing,' she said with a questioning look at Karenin. And having found the book and sat down again, she opened it. 
 But you will see...' she was about to begin reading when the footman came in again. 'Borozdina? 
 Say "To-morrow at two"... Yes,' she went on, keeping her finger in the book to mark the place, and sighed, looking with her beautiful dreamy eyes straight before her. 
 All the same, I think I have not done anything to shock them up till now. 
 Why is he Bezzubov?' Suddenly Oblonsky felt his nether jaw dropping irresistibly for a yawn. 
 But whereas Oblonsky's sleep would, he imagined, have offended them – he did not really even think this, for everything seemed so strange – Landau's sleep delighted them extremely, especially Lydia Ivanovna. 
 Karenin rose, and though he tried to be cautious he caught against the table. 
 [Let the person who arrived last, the one who questions, go out! Let him go out!] the Frenchman said, without opening his eyes. 
 When their relations are indefinite it is impossible for them to make any move. 
 Many families continue for years in their old ruts, hated by both husband and wife, merely because there is neither complete discord nor harmony. 
 This love was diminishing; therefore, in her judgment, part of his love must have been transferred to other women, or to one other woman. 
 She was jealous, not of any one woman, but of the diminution of his love. 
 And being jealous, Anna was indignant with him and constantly sought reasons to justify her indignation. 
 He could not live buried in the country as she desired. 
 Even the rare moments of tenderness which occurred between them did not pacify her; in his tenderness she now saw a tinge of calm assurance which had not been there before and irritated her. 
 Passing ever backwards from the memorably offensive words of the quarrel to their cause, she at last got back to the beginning of their conversation. 
 'I don't expect you to understand me and my feelings, as an affectionate man would; but I did expect ordinary delicacy,' she said. 
 'I am to blame; I am irritable and unreasonably jealous. 
 I need calm and confidence; and I will take the blame on myself. Yes, now, as soon as he comes back, I will tell him I was to blame, though in fact I was not, and we will go away!' 
 When he returned she told him, partly repeating words she had prepared, how she had spent the day and her plans for the move to the country. 
 'Do you know, it came to me almost like an inspiration?' said she. 
 Vronsky named the guests. 'The dinner was capital, the boat-races and everything quite nice, but in Moscow they can't get on without doing something ridiculous... 
 Wait a bit! The day after to-morrow is Sunday, and I must go and see maman,' said Vronsky, and became confused, because as soon as he had mentioned his mother he felt an intent and suspicious gaze fixed upon him. 
 'I never boast and never tell untruths,' he said softly, restraining his rising anger. 'It is a great pity if you don't respect...' 
 And standing before her he slowly brought out: 'Why are you testing my patience?' He looked as if he could have said much more, but restrained himself. 
 'Stop! St-o-op!' said Vronsky, his brow still knit, but holding her back by the hand. 
 And I repeat that a man who reproaches me because he has given up everything for my sake,' said she, recalling the words of a still earlier quarrel, 'is worse than a dishonourable man! He is a heartless man!' 
 In her soul there was another vague idea, which alone interested her, but of which she could not get hold. 
 Again remembering Karenin, she also remembered her illness after her confinement, and the feeling that never left her at that time. 
 She remembered. her words, 'Why did I not die?' and her feelings then. And suddenly she understood what was in her soul. 
 Pretending to be putting away her rings, she did not even turn round. 
 FEELING THAT THEY WERE ENTIRELY RECONCILED, next morning Anna began actively to make preparations for their move. 
 She stood in her room before an open trunk, sorting clothes, when he came in earlier than usual and ready dressed. 
 I will only sort out these things that are not wanted,' she said, placing some more articles on the heap of old clothes already piled up on Annushka's arms. 
 There was nothing odd in his receiving a telegram, but, as if wishing to hide something from her, he told the man that the receipt was in his study and hastily turned to her, saying: 
 The possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute, and it irritated her. 
 It's all words, words, words!' she said, looking at him with hatred. 
 'Decide... and I have decided,' she said and was about to go away, but just then Yashvin entered. 
 'I never asked myself, Anna Arkadyevna, whether I am sorry or not. 
 Meeting his look, her face suddenly assumed a coldly severe expression, as if to say: 'It is not forgotten. 
 'Gambetta's certificate; I have sold him,' he replied in a tone which said more clearly than words: 'I have no time for explanations, and they would lead to nothing.' 
 [So much the worse for her.] But, as he was going out, he thought she said something, and suddenly his heart ached with pity for her. 
 'If it's nothing, then tant pis!' he thought, again chilled. Turning away, he went out. 
 This was the first time it had been so, and this was not even a quarrel. 
 How could he look at her as he had looked when he came into the room for the certificate? 
 And recalling all the cruel words he had uttered, Anna invented other words which he evidently had wished to say and could have said to her, and she grew more and more exasperated. 
 'How could I leave the room without saying anything? But now she is no more! 
 The carriage rolled away; he ran rapidly upstairs again. 
 He glanced at her, frowned for an instant, and continued to read a letter. 
 'Oh, by the way –' he said when she was already in the doorway – 'we are definitely going to-morrow, aren't we?' 
 She stuck it down and gave it to the man. Then, afraid to remain alone now, she followed him out of the room and went to the nursery. 
 'How is this? That's not it – this is not he! 
 Having, in answer to the questions of the English nurse, said that she was quite well and that they were going to the country next day, Anna sat down beside the child and began twirling the stopper round in front of her. 
 But the child's loud ringing laughter and a movement of her eyebrows reminded Anna so vividly of Vronsky, that, repressing her sobs, she rose hurriedly and left the room. 
 Oh! And did I brush my hair or not?' she asked herself; but could not remember. 
 She did not even trust her hand, and went up to the mirror to see whether her hair really was done or not. It was, but she could not remember doing it. 
 Her messenger had returned in the carriage. 
 Ready dressed and with her bonnet on, she again looked at Annushka's placid and now still rounder face. 
 'Yes, I will go,' said Anna, recovering and rousing herself; 'and if a telegram comes during my absence, send it to Darya Alexandrovna's... 
 Now the idea of death no longer seemed so terrible and clear, and death itself no longer seemed inevitable. 
 I won't submit to him; I won't let him educate me... 
 It was Annushka's husband. 'Our parasite,' she remembered how Vronsky had said the words. 
 'No! I shall go to Dolly's, and will tell her frankly: "I am unhappy, I deserve it; I am guilty, but all the same I am unhappy. 
 And of me he thinks with hate and regrets having joined himself to me!' 
 'We also had a telegram from him,' replied Anna, looking round for Kitty. 
 It is still worse for me; it is harder than ever!' She heard the voices of the sisters conferring together in the next room. 
 No, and even Dolly would not understand. It is no use appealing to her. 
 She will come directly,' Dolly said awkwardly, not knowing how to tell an untruth. 'Oh, here she is!' 
 She would have concealed it; but her chief feeling would have been joy that I am punished for the pleasures she has envied me. 
 I shall tell him that when he comes back,' she thought and smiled. 
 'I will look,' he replied, and glancing at his desk he took up and handed her the thin square envelope of a telegram. 'I cannot return before ten – Vronsky,' she read. 
 The servants, the walls, the things in the house, all repelled and angered her, and oppressed her like a weight. 
 Dinner was served. She went to the table, smelt the bread and cheese and as the smell of everything eatable revolted her, she sent for the carriage and went out. 
 'What was the last thing I thought of that was so good?' She tried to remember it. 
 'Count Vronsky and I have also been unable to find that pleasure from which we expected so much.' And now for the first time Anna turned the bright light in which she saw everything upon her relations with him, about which she had always avoided thinking. 
 She remembered his words, the expression of his face, suggestive of a faithful setter's, in the early days of their union. 
 Now that is past. There is nothing to be proud of. 
 He is weary of me and is trying not to act dishonourably toward me. Yesterday he betrayed himself – he wants the divorce and a marriage in order to burn his boats. 
 'No, I have no longer the right flavour for him. If I go away he will, at the bottom of his heart, be pleased.' 
 That was not a surmise. She saw it clearly in the piercing light which now revealed to her the meaning of life and of human relations. 
 And this desire awakens disgust in him, and that arouses anger in me, and it cannot be otherwise. 
 Will Serezha stop asking and wondering about my two husbands? 
 As she moved among the crowd toward the first-class waiting-room she gradually recalled all the details of her position and the resolutions between which she vacillated. 
 And again hope and despair, alternately chafing the old sores, lacerated the wounds of her tortured and violently fluttering heart. Sitting on the star-shaped couch, waiting for her train, she looked with repulsion at those who passed in and out. 
 A misshapen lady with a bustle (Anna mentally stripped that woman and was horrified at her deformity) and a girl, laughing affectedly, ran past outside. 
 'Catherine Andreevna has everything, ma tante!' cried the little girl. 
 And remembering her dream she went to the opposite door, trembling with fright. 
 It was so clear to Anna that no one had any cause for joy that this laughter jarred on her painfully, and she wished to stop her ears, not to hear it. 
 Anna forgot her fellow-travellers; softly rocked by the motion of the carriage and inhaling the fresh air, she again began to think: 
 'Reason has been given to man to enable him to escape from his troubles,' said the lady, in French, evidently pleased with her phrase and mincing with her tongue. 
 Directing her searchlight upon them, Anna thought she saw their story and all the hidden recesses of their souls. 
 Why not put out the candle, if there is nothing more to look at? If everything is repulsive to look at? 
 Recollecting that she meant to go on if there was no reply, she stopped a porter and asked him whether there was not a coachman bringing a note from Count Vronsky there. 
 'Very sorry the note did not catch me. 
 Suddenly remembering the man who had been run over the day she first met Vronsky, she realized what she had to do. 
 Quickly and lightly descending the steps that led from the water-tank to the rails, she stopped close to the passing tram. 
 Koznyshev had calculated exactly the time necessary for a review to be written; but a month passed, and another, and the silence continued. 
 Despite his entire contempt for this man, Koznyshev began reading the review most respectfully. 
 The critic had evidently understood the book in an impossible way. 
 His position was the more painful because, having finished his book, he no longer had any literary work such as had previously occupied the greater part of his time. 
 The more he went into this question, the clearer it seemed to him that it was a matter which would attain enormous proportions and become epoch-making. 
 After working all through the spring and part of the summer, it was not till July that he prepared to go to his brother's in the country. 
 And do you always come to see them off?' he asked with a slight smile. 
 'More than eight hundred: counting those who did not go from Moscow direct, more than a thousand,' said Koznyshev. 
 They were talking of the latest telegram, confirming the report that for three consecutive days the Turks had been beaten at all points and were in flight, and that a decisive battle was expected next day. 
 Only his mother is seeing him off. 
 'Then you'll see my wife; I have written to her, but you'll see her sooner. Please tell her you have seen me and it's all right! 
 'What a pity you are going away,' said Oblonsky. 'To-morrow we are giving a dinner to two of those who are going to the war: Dmitry Bartnyansky from Petersburg and our Veslovsky – Vasenka. 
 HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF THE PRINCESS, Koznyshev with Katavasov, who had joined him, entered the very crowded carriage, and the train started. 
 Katavasov, however, whose scientific occupations had offered him no opportunities of studying the Volunteers, was much interested in them and questioned Koznyshev about them. 
 He was evidently drunk and was speaking of something that had happened at his school. 
 'Well, everybody is going. 
 One must help the Serbs. 
 'Why into the infantry, when they need artillerymen most of all?' said Katavasov, concluding from the artilleryman's age that he must have risen to a considerable rank. 
 'What a variety there is in the positions of all these men who are going there!' Katavasov remarked vaguely, wishing to express his own opinion but at the same time to draw the old man. 
 Katavasov returning to his carriage involuntarily prevaricated; and in telling Koznyshev his observations of the Volunteers, let it appear that they were excellent fellows. 
 'Yes, so I heard,' replied Koznyshev, stopping by her window and glancing inside. 'What a fine action this is of his!' he added, noticing that Vronsky was not there. 
 Oh, what I have endured!' she repeated when Koznyshev had entered and taken a seat beside her. 'You cannot imagine it! 
 You know he had once before shot himself on her account?' she said, and the old woman's brows knit at the recollection. 'Yes, she ended as such a woman deserved to end. 
 I felt as if I had received a blow! – I knew it was she! 
 But he had already been told. 
 Such desperate passions! 
 Well, she proved it! She ruined herself and two splendid men – her husband and my unfortunate son.' 
 For him, the husband, it is better. She has set him free. 
 He had thrown up everything – his career, me; and then she did not even pity him, but deliberately dealt him a deathblow. 
 No, say what you will, her death itself was the death of a horrid woman, without religion. 
 God forgive me! I cannot help hating her memory when I see my son's ruin!' 
 It was the only thing that could rouse him. His friend, Yashvin, had lost everything at cards and was going to Serbia. 
 Please have a talk with him. I want him to have some distraction. 
 Koznyshev said he would be very pleased, and crossed over to the other platform. 
 In his eyes Vronsky at that moment seemed an important worker in a great cause, and Koznyshev considered it his duty to encourage and cheer him. 
 'There is no one whom it would be less unpleasant for me to meet than yourself,' returned Vronsky. 'Excuse me. 
 'Yes, but it may be easier for you to establish connections (which will be necessary anyway) with some one who has been prepared. 
 The Volunteers are being very much attacked and a man like yourself will raise them in public opinion.' 
 'You will recover, I prophesy it,' said Koznyshev, feeling touched. 'To free one's brothers from oppression is an aim worth both dying and living for. 
 'Yes, as a tool I may be of some use. But as a man I – am a ruin!' said he, pausing between the words. 
 The acute pain in the strong tooth, filling his mouth with saliva, hindered his speaking. He remained silent, gazing at the wheels of the approaching tender, which was slowly and smoothly gliding over the rails. 
 Suddenly a quite different feeling, not of pain but of tormenting inward discomfort, made him for a moment forget his toothache. 
 He tried to recall his best moments with her but they were for ever poisoned. 
 He could think of her only-as triumphant, having carried out the threat of inflicting on him totally useless but irrevocable remorse. 
 Having twice walked past the sacks and mastered himself, he turned calmly to Koznyshev: 
 'We got here first-rate without troubling you,' replied Koznyshev. 'I am so dusty that I dare not touch you. 
 And you, as usual,' said he; smiling, 'are enjoying tranquil happiness outside the currents in your peaceful shadows. 
 'No, Papa, he is very nice, and Kostya is very fond of him,' Kitty replied with a smile as of entreaty, having noticed a sarcastic expression on her father's face. 
 'Has he been screaming long, Nurse? Long?' she asked hurriedly, sitting down and preparing to nurse the baby. 
 It's God's truth, Catherine Alexandrovna, dear, he knows me!' cried Agatha Mikhaylovna, raising her voice above the baby's. 
 At last, after desperate screaming and choking, matters went smoothly, and both mother and child felt calmed and were silent. 
 If he knew anyone it would be me,' Kitty replied to Agatha Mikhaylovna's statement, and smiled. 
 If I don't see to it, Agatha Mikhaylovna will give Sergius Ivanich used bed-linen!' and the very thought of this sent the blood into Kitty's face. 
 Better let him be that than be like Madame Stahl, or like what I wanted to be when I was abroad. 
 And his dread of hurting anybody's feelings, even a child's! 
 'Yes, only be like your father, only be like him!' she whispered, giving Mitya to the nurse, and touching his cheek with her lips. 
 Moreover, he was vaguely conscious that what he had called his convictions were really ignorance and, more than that, were a state of mind which rendered knowledge of what he needed impossible. 
 Involuntarily and unconsciously, in every book, in every conversation, and in every person he met, he now sought for their relation to those questions and for a solution to them. 
 Were they not pretending? Or did they understand possibly in some different and clearer way than he, the answers science gives to the questions he was concerned with? 
 He, an unbeliever, began xo pray, and while praying believed. 
 But that moment had passed, and he could not allot any place in his life to the state of mind he had then experienced. 
 Following long definitions of vague words such as spirit, will, freedom, substance, and deliberately entering the verbal trap set for him by the philosophers, or by himself, he seemed to begin to understand something. 
 It was just as necessary as to dine when hungry; and therefore just as it was necessary to prepare dinner, so it was necessary to arrange the husbandry at Pokrovsk in such a way as to derive an income from it. 
 Whether he was acting well or ill he did not know and far from laying down the law about it, he now avoided talking or thinking about it. 
 THE DAY WHEN KOZNYSHEV ARRIVED at Pokrovsk was one of Levin's most distressing days. 
 Why do they all make such efforts and try to show me their zeal? Why is my old friend Matrena toiling so (I doctored her after the fire, when she was struck by a girder)?' he thought, looking at a thin peasant woman who pushed the grain along with a rake, her dark sunburnt bare feet stepping with effort on the hard uneven barn floor. 
 Yet he loosens the sheaves and gives directions, shouts at the women, and quickly puts right the strap on the fly-wheel. And, moreover, not they only but I too shall be buried and nothing will be left. 
 'The rent is too high, Constantine Dmitrich,' answered Theodore, picking out the ears of rye from the front of his damp shirt. 
 But as if Daddy Plato would ever skin a man! 
 'How does he remember God? How does he live for the soul?' 
 Take you, for instance, you won't injure anyone either...' 
 'Yes, yes! Good-bye!' uttered Levin, gasping with excitement, and turning away, he took his stick and walked quickly away toward home. 
 He felt something new in his soul and probed this something with pleasure, not yet knowing what it was. 
 And not I alone but every one – the whole world – only understands that completely. 
 Nobody is free from doubt about other things, but nobody ever doubts this one thing, everybody always agrees with it. {??} 
 I, and all other men, know only one thing firmly, clearly, and certainly, and this knowledge cannot be explained by reason: it is outside reason, has no cause, and can have no consequences. 
 'What greater miracle could there be than that? 
 I have understood the Power that not only gave me life in the past but is giving me life now. 
 I have freed myself from deception and learnt to know my Master. 
 Nothing of that which constitutes the chief joys of my life would have existed for me.' And although he made the greatest efforts of imagination, he could not picture to himself the bestial creature he would have been, had he not known what he was living for. 
 'Where did I get it from? Was it by reason that I attained to the knowledge that I must love my neighbour and not throttle him? 
 They told me so when I was a child, and I gladly believed it, because they told me what was already in my soul. But who discovered it? 
 But the law of loving others could not be discovered by reason, because it is unreasonable.' 
 And chiefly roguery of mind, precisely roguery. Just mind-swindling,' he repeated. 
 LEVIN REMEMBERED A RECENT SCENE between Dolly and her children. 
 Left by themselves, the children had started cooking raspberries over a candle, and pouring jets of milk into their mouths. 
 There is no need for us to think about that, it's all ready for us; but we want to think out something of our own invention and new. 
 Now we've thought of putting raspberries in a cup and cooking them over a candle, and of pouring milk into each other's mouths like fountains. 
 'Supposing now that the children were left alone to procure or make cups for themselves and to milk the cows and so on. 
 Suppose we, with our passions and thoughts, were left without the conception of God a Creator, and without a conception of what is good, and without an explanation of moral evil! 
 He purposely thought of those teachings of the Church which always seemed most strange to him, and that tried him. 
 'But I know nothing, nothing! And can know nothing but what is told to me and to everybody.' 
 He wanted to say that it was a pity Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth so tight, but that would have sounded like a reproof, and Levin desired an amicable conversation. 
 But he could think of nothing else to say. 'Bear to the right, sir, there's a stump there,' said the coachman, taking hold of the rein. 
 'Please leave it alone and don't teach me!' said Levin, annoyed at the coachman's interference. 
 Just as it always did, interference vexed him, and he immediately felt how wrong had been his conclusion that his spiritual condition could at once alter his manner when confronted with reality. 
 'Well, and what are you doing?' asked Koznyshev, lagging behind with his brother. 
 'How right you were to come!' he said. 
 He was glad of this opportunity to be alone and recover from reality, which had already so lowered his spiritual condition. 
 He remembered that he had already got angry with Ivan, treated his brother coldly, and spoken heedlessly to Katavasov. 
 But at that instant returning into that mood, he felt with joy that something new and important had occurred within him. 
 Reality had temporarily veiled the spiritual tranquillity he had found, but it remained with him. 
 And as, in spite of the bees, his physical powers remained intact, so his newly realized spiritual powers were intact also. 
 'KOSTYA! DO YOU KNOW with whom Sergius Ivanich travelled coming here?' said Dolly, after she had distributed cucumbers and honey among the children. 
 You should have seen what went on at the station yesterday!' said Katavasov, audibly biting into a cucumber. 
 'The Turks!' answered Koznyshev, quietly smiling, having extracted the bee which, black with honey, moved its legs helplessly. as he shifted it from the knife to a firm aspen leaf. 
 'Well, and what is your theory?' asked Katavasov with a smile, evidently challenging Levin to a discussion. 'Why have private individuals no right?' 
 'Perhaps you have none, but others have,' said Koznyshev with a dissatisfied frown. 'Among the people there live traditions of Orthodox Christians suffering under the yoke of the "Infidel Mussulman." 
 But on getting back I was relieved, for I see that there are others besides me who are only interested in Russia and not in their brother-Slavs. 
 And on Sunday, in church?' remarked Dolly, who had been following the conversation. 
 'Please bring a towel,' she said to the old man, who was looking smilingly at the children. 'It's impossible that all...' 
 He neither knows nor thinks about it,' said Levin. 'Have you heard about the war, Mikhaylich?' he asked, addressing the old man. 
 Shall I bring some more bread and give the laddie a bit?' he asked Dolly, pointing to Grisha, who was finishing his crust. 
 'I tell you it's not hundreds, and not the happy-go-lucky people, but the best representatives of the people!' said Koznyshev, as irritably as if he were defending the last of his possessions. 'And the donations? 
 KOZNYSHEV, AN EXPERIENCED DIALECTICIAN, did not rejoin but immediately turned the conversation into another region. 
 Voting has not been introduced in our country, and cannot be because it does not express the people's will, but there are other means. 
 The most divergent parties in the intellectual world, previously so hostile to one another, have all merged into one. 
 They prevent our hearing anything else!' 
 'About that unanimity, something else can be said,' rejoined the Prince. 'There's my son-in-law, Stephen Arkadyevich, you know him. 
 You just ask him if his work will be any use, and he will prove to you that it is most necessary! 
 'I would make only one stipulation,' continued the Prince. 'Alphonse Karr put it very well, before the war with Prussia. 
 'And if they run, put grapeshot behind them, or Cossacks with whips!' said the Prince. 
 'Every member of Society is called upon to do his proper task,' he said. 'And men of thought perform theirs by expressing public opinion. 
 Levin flushed with annoyance, not at being beaten, but because he had not refrained from the dispute. 
 He saw that it was not possible to convince his brother and Katavasov, and still less did he see any possibility of himself agreeing with them. 
 He said the same as Mikhaylich and the people who expressed their thought in the legend of the invitation to the Varyags [The Norse chiefs who, at the dawn of Russian history, were invited by the Slav tribes of Russia to come and rule over them and establish order.]: 'Come and rule over us! 
 A white curtain of pouring rain was already descending over the distant wood and half the neighbouring field, and was advancing rapidly toward the Kolok. 
 Kitty's wet and rosy face was turned to him, timidly smiling beneath her bedraggled hat. 
 Mitya was safe and dry and slept undisturbed. 
 Leaving his tea and regretting the interruption in the interesting conversation, yet uneasy as to why he was sent for, as this only happened on important occasions; Levin went to the nursery. 
 He at once returned to the feeling that directed him, which was related to those thoughts, and he found that feeling in his soul yet more powerful and definite than before. 
 Now it was not as it used to be with him when he. had invented ways of tranquillizing himself and had been obliged to recapitulate the whole train of reflections in order to arrive at the feeling. 
 What relation to that revelation have the Buddhist and the Mahomedan faiths, which also teach and do good? 
 Look!' she said when her husband came up. 'Agatha Mikhaylovna was right. 
 The nurse lifted the baby out of the bath with one hand and poured fresh water over him, then he was wrapped up and dried, and after a penetrating yell he was given to his mother. 
 'No, did I say I felt nothing? 
 'Not so much with him as with my own feeling; I had expected more. 
 I had expected that, like a surprise, a new, pleasant feeling would awaken in me. 
 She listened attentively, replacing on her slender fingers, across the baby, the rings she had taken off to bath Mitya. 
 'I am asking about the relation to the Deity of all the different beliefs of mankind. I am asking about the general revelation of God to the whole universe with all those cloudy nebulae. 
 'Oh, you've not gone?' suddenly asked Kitty, who was passing that way to the drawing-room. 
 Yes, I will...' But just as he was going to speak, she began: 
 Be good and go to the corner room and see how they have arranged things for Sergius Ivanich! 
 'Yes, certainly I will,' said Levin, standing upright and kissing her. 
 'No, I had better not tell her,' he thought when she had passed out before him. 'It is a secret, necessary and important for me alone, and inexpressible in words.' 
 But be it faith or not – I do not know what it is – this feeling has also entered imperceptibly through suffering and is firmly rooted in my soul. 
 She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: "Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--" 
 I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. 
 Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. 
 The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said: "But you ain't too warm now, though." 
 "Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?" 
 In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle carried white thread and the other black. 
 Confound it! sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. 
 But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. 
 It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. 
 His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. 
 The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. 
 If one moved, the other moved--but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time. 
 Finally Tom said: 
 So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. 
 "I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up. 
 "Well, you _said_ you'd do it--why don't you do it?" "By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it." 
 The boy only struggled to free himself. 
 The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the "next time he caught him out." 
 To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope. 
 He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. 
 Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. 
 Gimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute. _She_ won't ever know." 
 She talks awful, but talk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry. 
 "My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! 
 He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. 
 He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. 
 The left hand began to describe circles. 
 Tom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. 
 Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. 
 Ben ranged up alongside of him. 
 Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. 
 All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer." "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you _like_ it?" 
 You see, Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and _she_ wouldn't. 
 "No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. 
 "Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let Sid. 
 If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. 
 There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign. The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to report. 
 The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. 
 She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. 
 He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to "show off" in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. 
 The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. 
 Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. 
 Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. 
 He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. 
 This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. 
 He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower. 
 And thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. 
 There was a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom. 
 Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had any dim idea of making any "references to allusions," he thought better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye. 
 Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai. 
 Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter. 
 "Blessed are the--a--a--" 
 "Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--" 
 Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--" 
 "Oh, _shall_! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--blessed are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for they shall--a--shall _what_? 
 Why don't you tell me, Mary?--what do you want to be so mean for?" 
 But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck. 
 Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. 
 [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] 
 He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. 
 The church's high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple. 
 Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. 
 Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. 
 Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. 
 He began after this fashion: "Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. 
 There--that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. 
 A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife. 
 The next moment he was "showing off" with all his might--cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. 
 Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. 
 And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. 
 Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. 
 He always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. 
 And besides, he had been "thrown up to them" so much. 
 It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country. 
 His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board: Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry _beds_ of ease, 
 The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them. 
 By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. 
 He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious. 
 Tom, what is the matter?" 
 Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town, and tell her--" 
 The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost. 
 Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him. 
 I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many warts. 
 You see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes." 
 "Well, I reckon it's so, then. 
 Last time, you kep' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window--but don't you tell." 
 I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I'll meow this time. 
 Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the girls' side of the school-house. 
 He instantly said: 
 The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. 
 Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. 
 And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: "_I love you_." 
 His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. 
 She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered, "I--love--you!" 
 Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron to her face. 
 By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. 
 "No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody but you--and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either." 
 And always coming to school or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't anybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that's the way you do when you're engaged." 
 "Becky, won't you say something?" 
 Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said: "Please, Becky, won't you take it?" 
 She struck it to the floor. 
 She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. 
 He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. 
 The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. 
 But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time. 
 How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore! 
 He thought he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. 
 But it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a patient search for it. But he could not find it. 
 Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest. 
 "Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting--for they talked "by the book," from memory. 
 I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the book. 
 Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse. 
 All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. 
 "Sacred to the memory of" So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light. 
 "Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. 
 Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!" "All right, I'll keep still. 
 Here they come again. Now they're hot. 
 They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's Injun Joe." 
 Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground. 
 The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. 
 Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. 
 Three--four--five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. 
 But it's in my head yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle; can't recollect anything of it, hardly. 
 I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. 
 Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood looking after him. 
 "And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!" 
 So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. 
 Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. 
 There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart. 
 At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and voices shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!" 
 People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed. 
 "Infernal impudence!" said a bystander; "wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work, I reckon--didn't expect any company." 
 He saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed: 
 "Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get--" He shuddered; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, "Tell 'em, Joe, tell 'em--it ain't any use any more." 
 Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head, and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. 
 The boys thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were disappointed, for more than one villager remarked: 
 "It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it." 
 He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again. 
 The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was seldom occupied. 
 He had been careful to begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present. 
 She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. 
 Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. 
 She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it. 
 "Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self." 
 Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. 
 Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. 
 The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter. 
 Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble. 
 This was putting the thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too. 
 At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. 
 Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. 
 The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head right, and then lay on their oars. 
 They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn "pone" stock they had brought. 
 When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with contentment. 
 Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!" 
 He had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. 
 "No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women--they're too noble. And the women's always beautiful, too. 
 They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe. 
 They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. 
 They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. 
 A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and "sniffing around," then proceeding again--for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. 
 A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, "Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and she took wing and went off to see about it--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. 
 A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. 
 A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the "fox" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not. 
 Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar. 
 Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. 
 They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too. 
 They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp. 
 There were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing. 
 He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed to suit him. 
 "But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't _bad_, so to say--only misch_ee_vous. 
 "_Sid!_" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not see it. 
 I don't know how to give him up! He was such a comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most." 
 And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. 
 Then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. 
 He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over. 
 His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark hastily in his pocket. 
 Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him. 
 He had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. 
 "Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. 
 "Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one. 
 "Well, go 'long--who's hendering you." 
 He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction. 
 "It's just nothing." 
 "Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could," said Tom. 
 "Yes, that's so," said Huck. "That was the day after I lost a white alley. 
 Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings followed every time. 
 You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it." 
 Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain. 
 They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. 
 By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands. 
 And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. 
 No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. 
 Presently she stopped, and said to herself: 
 As the "sold" congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once more. 
 "Would you, Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. 
 "It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing. 
 Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said: 
 Next you said I warn't _bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something." 
 "And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer--" 
 "And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went." 
 And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and drink to him. 
 They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material. 
 Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. 
 She'll let anybody come that I want, and I want you." 
 Becky's lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good cry." 
 He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. 
 Tom hinted at things he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. 
 Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy! 
 His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress. 
 So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on, crying. 
 She started homeward, now, intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed. 
 She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain. 
 "Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't." 
 "I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power of sins, Tom. 
 I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. 
 He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. 
 Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said: "I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. 
 Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss Smarty?" until the right time to say it had gone by. 
 "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! 
 Then she stamped her little foot and said: 
 Presently he said to himself: 
 Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the room Becky's face troubled him. 
 She did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. 
 Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils. 
 "Yet shame I not to bear an o'erfull heart, Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes; 'Tis from no stranger land I now must part, 'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs. 
 "'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my side. 
 The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most "eloquent" thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it. 
 He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. 
 He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. 
 A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever. There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder. 
 It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself. 
 "What is the talk around, Huck? 
 But he's kind of good--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two; and lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck." 
 "Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line. I wish we could get him out of there." 
 Well, boys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that's the only way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it's right. 
 Stand a litter furder west--so--that's it; it's a prime comfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. 
 At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be. 
 One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve. That is to say, he "found a clew." 
 "No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else they die. 
 Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds. How's that?" 
 Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. 
 "That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. 
 "Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted house in the day nor the night." 
 There in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the "ha'nted" house, utterly isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof caved in. 
 Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them-- 
 There's some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain't." 
 All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for today, and play. 
 Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?" 
 "Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the best. 
 He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half." 
 As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill. 
 No--coming.... Here they are. 
 I wanted to yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view." 
 I'll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more, for a look. 
 All right, though--nothing's happened." 
 He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife. 
 "I'll need your help in it. 
 The steps came creaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. 
 He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his "revenge" was satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing. 
 He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to "hundreds" and "thousands" were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. 
 He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one's possession. 
 If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars. 
 If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream. 
 A feller don't have only one chance for such a pile--and that one's lost. 
 The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store. 
 And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. 
 He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet. 
 I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either. 
 I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. 
 Now, if we watch every night, we'll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning." 
 I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job." 
 "Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't come bothering around. 
 The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented. 
 Then Becky reflected a moment and said: 
 The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day. 
 After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. 
 The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. 
 By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the day. 
 Huck's heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. 
 He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas' grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard to find. 
 "Damn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is." 
 Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. 
 He had me _horsewhipped_!--horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on! _Horsewhipped_!--do you understand? 
 My friend, you'll help me in this thing--for _my_ sake--that's why you're here--I mightn't be able alone. 
 Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but cautiously along. 
 There was a lagging, anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry. 
 The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window: "Who's there!" 
 "Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!" 
 As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. 
 They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. 
 He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. 
 He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said: 
 "My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all the world. 
 This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't cover that up now. 
 During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. 
 The Welshman started--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten--then replied: "Of burglar's tools. 
 But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable. 
 In fact, everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption. 
 Those fellows warn't likely to come again--they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? 
 In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names "BECKY & TOM" had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. 
 Huck started up in bed, wildeyed: "What? 
 So the treasure was gone forever--gone forever! 
 Curious that she should cry. These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. 
 The widow said to herself: "There--he's asleep, poor wreck. 
 They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as "The Drawing-Room," "The Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on. 
 Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. 
 In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. 
 They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange. 
 Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last she said: 
 She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more. 
 A long time after this--they could not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water--they must find a spring. 
 All that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. 
 Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! 
 He was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the "Spaniard" take to his heels and get himself out of sight. 
 Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. 
 She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over. 
 Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came from the cave. 
 Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who shouted, "Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!" 
 And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! 
 "Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and triple-locked--and I've got the keys." 
 Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. 
 The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. 
 In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. 
 The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick--a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. 
 It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. 
 Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it. 
 Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now. 
 I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. 
 "Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, "whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways it's a goner for us, Tom." 
 Will you go in there with me and help get it out?" 
 Waylay people--that's mostly the way." 
 You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the general way. 
 You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. 
 Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave. 
 "Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that." 
 They went on, and presently entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the "jumping-off place." 
 Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice: 
 "No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here." 
 Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. 
 It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip. 
 The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock. 
 We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies." 
 "Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe. 
 "I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. 
 They're Huck's--no, no thanks, Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. 
 This time it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night. 
 Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here--couldn't get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!" 
 Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room, after the fashion of that country and that day. 
 At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was another person whose modesty-- And so forth and so on. 
 He sprung his secret about Huck's share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. 
 However, the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze and everybody's laudations. 
 The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. 
 Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. 
 It was just what the minister got--no, it was what he was promised--he generally couldn't collect it. 
 Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas' protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. 
 I hain't slid on a cellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! 
 "Tom, it don't make no difference. 
 I got to ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do everything. 
 Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort--I'd got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. 
 I _had_ to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school's going to open, and I'd a had to go to it--well, I wouldn't stand _that_, Tom. 
 Tom, I wouldn't ever got into all this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take my sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not many times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable hard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder." 
 You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't." 
 "Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom." 
 "It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang." 
 Why, it's a million times bullier than pirating. 
 I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet." 
 Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.
