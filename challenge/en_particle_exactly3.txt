 Georgiana , when not unburdening her heart to me , spent most of her time in lying on the sofa , fretting about the dulness of the house , and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town .
 `` At any rate , it makes us no worse off than we were before , '' remarked Mary .
 Hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and held it out to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , with a yelp of delight , and rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ; and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut .
 `` Now who can trouble you , since in six months you 'll draw the arrears for your cottage , and I do n't make the last bill due till after you 've been paid ? ''
 The next moment she would certainly go into her room , where K. ought not to intrude in the middle of the night ; that meant he would have to speak to her now , but , unfortunately , he had not put the electric light on in his room so that when he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an attack and would certainly , at the very least , have been quite alarming .
 Wait here till I 've put the light on in my room , and then turn the light down out here . "
 K. ran the few steps up to him , but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and , if necessary , throttle him , the woman said ,
 If that had been his intention then it would almost have been easier , K. would have taken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the policemen 's place .
 In the end , they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out .
 The good intentions he had had earlier , though , seemed to have left him completely , it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and sometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary under some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation , but then he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the Italian without saying a word , so , with in an even greater rage , he pulled the dictionary back out again .
 Here they released their hold on K. , who just waited in silence , and took their top hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off their brows with their handkerchiefs .
 The wind seemed only to have waited for her : it whistled merrily and tried to seize and carry her off , but she held on to the cold door-post and held down her shawl , then stepping on to the platform she moved away from the carriage .
 But have a wash and smarten yourself up , ' said the Baroness , again sitting down and carefully turning a small screw of the coffee-pot . ' Pierre , pass me the coffee , ' she said to Petritsky whom , not concealing their relations , she called Pierre ( the French for Peter ) , because of his surname .
 Chirikov gaily and good-naturedly backed up every one else .
 It was the most stunning surprise of the decade , and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one 's altitude , and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one .
